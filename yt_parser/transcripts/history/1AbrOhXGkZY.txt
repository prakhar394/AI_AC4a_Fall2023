Mom had approached your dad
with a marriage proposal for you.
But dad refused.
Okay, I get it now, dad.
You came up with a good plan.
The perfect way to
convince me for marriage.
Last time, it was a matrimonial
site and now it's this.
Well done.
What are you saying?
What matrimonial site?
What is she saying?
You were also here.
You're also here.
Both of you have heard what I said.
Did I talk of marriage even once?
Did I even mention
the word? No, right?
You may not have
said it, but I can hear it.
Then clean your ears.
You're hearing too much.
Your ears are ringing.
Dad, please sit. Drink some water.
I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.
Last time, you said that
you don't want to get married.
I stopped talking about marriage.
Because I respected your decision.
At least, respect my
decision too. Even if you don't,
but at least don't interfere in it.
[music playing]
Look, if you manage your life,
then automatically my
life will get managed too.
You're after me all the time.
Just like a tail.
Dad...
Why are you talking
to her like this?
[music playing]
[thudding]
- Dad...
- Don't touch me.
No one will mess with
my belongings now.
- Otherwise, I will...
- Otherwise what, Mr. Sharma?
I'm leaving tomorrow
and that is final.
All three of you take
care of each other.
[music playing]
You have a problem with
me, Mr. Jaidev Sharma?
I don't care even a bit.
Yes, drink cold water.
Make your throat sore.
I'll keep meddling like this.
You're dancing on my head.
Yes, I will dance on your
head. Do you have a problem?
[door closes]
Wow! What a father-daughter duo!
It looks like we were
picked up from a trash can.
No, sister.
We were born in this house.
You...
You're my most stubborn daughter.
So stubborn!
Crazy girl, I...
I can't see you sad
even for a moment.
Whatever I'm doing
is because you're forcing me to.
I'm doing all this for
your well-being, dear.
I'm sorry, dear.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
She is used to
the comforts of her
house. Nothing else.
But who will explain to her, mom,
that talent alone doesn't suffice?
That's right.
Look at yourself.
Had you been caught
up with household
chores, would you
have worked in a bank?
And now, look at you, you have
an identity, your individuality.
A few people know you.
Otherwise, you'd have
just been busy with chores.
I'm saying, shall we have tea?
You've worked enough.
- But...
- I won't let
anyone come in between
me, my tea and my wife.
[music playing]
Thank you.
It's good.
It's very good.
[laughing]
Thank you, Aparna.
- Hey!
- Hmm?
Why are you sulking?
Nothing, dad.
He's angry with a girl.
Of course. I had recommended her.
You're angry with her because you
recommended her and she refused.
So?
So? Who's wrong here?
Come on, mom. Not again. Dad, why
are you quiet? Tell her who's wrong.
Okay, wait.
No, dear. You assumed
that she should go to Dubai.
And she refused. Did you ask her?
What's there to ask?
You did the same thing with Anurag.
You entered his name
in the poetry competition
because he was good with poetry.
But did you ask him?
One second, why are
you delving into the past?
I was in school then,
this was in sixth grade.
- We're adults now.
- But you're still the same.
Since childhood, you've
remained just the same.
Without giving it enough
thought, or seeking permission,
you make decisions on their behalf.
And when something goes
wrong, then you get upset.
Whatever, mom. But
I don't agree with this.
Her decision was
wrong. It was a no-brainer.
Yes, then don't agree,
but think about it.
It's possible that the girl
might have her compulsions.
What compulsions?
I don't know.
She must have her reasons.
In fact, I liked her decision.
She didn't come under
pressure and take a decision.
She knows exactly what she wants.
It's possible that she might want
to get married, not go anywhere.
She might want to
live with her family.
At least, she knows
what is more important to her.
I'll go and help
Kusum in the kitchen.
[chopping sound]
I have given you my
entire life, my entire youth.
Will you three snatch
away my old age too?
[chopping sound]
You'll cut your finger.
Sister, do you also feel that
it's my fault?
You sense something about dad.
It's possible that you're correct.
But...
It's also possible that you're
getting worried needlessly.
Maybe we're overthinking about him.
If he wants to go, then let him.
We keep telling him that he
doesn't have friends and relatives,
and now when he wants to go to
meet his friend, we're stopping him.
Assume that this is his
vacation after retirement.
Stop being angry and let him go.
Sister, don't forget
to take the pickle.
Otherwise, dad will
get upset with me for it.
Oh!
- Take care. Don't be angry.
- Hmm.
Tanu.
Dad, we're leaving.
[music playing]
Dad, we're leaving.
Dad!
[music playing]
Bye. Take care.
You too.
[music playing]
[music playing]
Oh! Thanks so much, Varun.
I was feeling very stressed.
This entire area is stiff.
You know, dad and Pallu
were fighting like kids today.
If I shut one up, the
other started shouting.
Both of them were so angry.
It was a very intense argument.
You don't get so stressed.
You always say that they
can't be without each other.
And I'm telling you,
in just two hours,
both of them would be
cooking in the kitchen together.
Wanna bet?
Actually, that's true.
By the way,
my meeting with the
investor went very well today.
- Really?
- I'm very positive.
I'll surely get the
funding this time.
Finally, everything
will get on track.
Touch wood. You've
worked hard, Varun.
[music playing]
Hey!
Just working hard isn't
enough. One needs support.
And you've given me that, always.
And that's why, I
was able to do all this.
Let it be. That's not true.
I don't say it.
But that doesn't
mean that I don't see it.
[kissing]
But you'll see,
as soon as our investors'
funding gets cleared,
you can do whatever you want.
- And first of all, quit your job.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
And after that, we'll
buy a holiday home.
Either in Manali or Goa. You decide.
Okay.
[phone beeps]
- Holiday home...
- One moment.
[music playing]
The management has found out
about the incident on the flight.
They're a bit upset and
want to meet you tomorrow.
All of you are our servants.
We're available at your service.
But we are not your
personal servants.
Two people were
fired from the job today.
Nowadays, all airlines
are cutting costs.
They just need excuses
to fire all the staff.
[footsteps approaching]
[music playing]
[music playing]
He's getting old, but
his actions are like a kid.
'He's acting as if he's
actually going to leave.'
'I know that he won't go anywhere.'
'He'll be at home when
I return in the evening.'
[traffic sound]
Who brought these cupcakes?
Me.
Isn't it nice?
I don't know. If
I'm told after tasting
that you've been fired
from the job. Then?
No, you're not losing your job.
I was just pretending
that I can also bake.
Try.
Oh, I thought that
maybe you've realised your mistake.
That's why you
brought this to say sorry.
Sorry for what?
[music playing]
I usually don't get
so angry with anyone.
What happened? Did you
drink bitter tea in the morning?
Here's something sweet.
Pallavi, I agree that we
started on the wrong foot.
That's why, let's start over.
With a smile.
Okay.
[music playing]
[music playing]
Hmm. It's nice.
I know, I made it after all.
You won't work today.
Hmm.
Excuse me.
Everyone. Can I have your attention?
All of you, please.
Guys, no one's going to work today.
I thought that we work every
day, all through the week
only for our customers, right?
Then why not give ourselves
some time on one day?
Work for ourselves.
Serve ourselves.
What do you think?
So, this is the new policy
of this hotel from now.
One day every week.
For a few hours, this restaurant
will be open only for us.
We will cook for ourselves.
We'll serve ourselves.
We will be our own guest.
[clapping]
What are you waiting for?
Let's cook for ourselves.
Okay? I'll join you
guys too, come on.
If you hand me the knife in
my hand, it leads to a fight.
Thank you so much for
saving me from a fight.
Otherwise, it's
very difficult to be a
delivery boy and bring
cupcakes everyday.
I mean, to bake cupcakes.
[music playing]
- Shall we begin?
- Yeah.
Tanu, give me something
to eat. I'm starving.
[music playing]
Tanu?
[music playing]
[music playing]
Sandwiches and coffee.
Where's the milk?
[milk pouring]
[music playing]
Where's the coffee?
So you're hiding here.
Oh no!
Oh!
Oh!
Who is it? Rakesh, what are you
doing in the kitchen at this hour?
Mom, I was just
trying to make coffee
and I broke the jar. That's it.
Glass! Step back,
dear. You'll get hurt.
Mom, I'm fine.
Rakesh, why did you come to the
kitchen? You could've woken me up.
And how did this jar break?
What do you mean? He's not
used to working in the kitchen.
Moreover, I have never
let Rakesh enter the kitchen.
And you're blaming him instead.
- Where were you?
- Mom, it's okay.
- But son...
- Mom, Tanvi has a fever.
Huh?
I came to make coffee
because she had fallen asleep.
Otherwise, she'd never
let me enter the kitchen.
Take care of yourself, dear.
It's Rahul's birthday
tomorrow, dear.
If you don't attend
it, it won't look nice.
Mom, please go and
rest. I'll clean everything.
- We'll manage this. Don't worry.
- Okay, I'll go and rest.
- I'll go.
- I'll drop you.
[glass clinking]
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?
- Rakesh, please go out. I'll do it.
- Tanu, you're unwell.
And it's Rahul's birthday tomorrow.
You've to get fit by tomorrow.
I'll do all this, don't worry.
[crickets chirping]
Ta-da!
Piping hot coffee and sandwiches.
Here, have some coffee.
Thank you.
Tanu, I was thinking that
it's Rahul's birthday tomorrow,
so why not book a nice hotel
and celebrate his birthday lavishly?
But why a hotel?
Tanu, you're unwell.
And I know that you'll
be stressed all day.
I don't want that, that's why.
But Rakesh, it'll be very expensive.
Oh god! You're always
complaining about expenses.
Tanu, if you want
to discuss budgets
and expenses, then
do that with mom.
Don't get stressed.
Drink your coffee. It'll get cold.
How is it?
[grinning]
[coughing]
Tanu, how will our child speak
the truth when the mom is a liar?
But I'll drink it.
[gate opening]
[gate closing]
[music playing]
Dad?
[music playing]
Why is the house so silent?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
[door opening]
'I'm leaving tomorrow
and that is final.'
Dad!
Dad!
He really left.
'I'm leaving tomorrow
and that is final.'
[sobbing]
There's only half an hour left
for the flight.
[music playing]
