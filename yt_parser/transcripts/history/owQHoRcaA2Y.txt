hello everyone welcome to today's video
my name is akshala babar and i study
data analytics at northeastern
university so you might have noticed the
change in the backdrop that's because i
am in san diego
and this is my sublet so this is the
place where i'm staying temporarily
temporarily for three months uh during
my internship so today's video is going
to be about the pros and cons of
northeastern university i was planning
to do this video for quite a long time
and finally
i've got some time now i have a lot of
time now so let's start with the pros
okay the first pro is that northeastern
university the main campus is situated
in boston so boston is an amazing city
uh it's called as the student city
because there are so many universities
we have
uh
we have harvard we have mit then there
is boston university northeastern
university so you can do a lot of
networking with students from these
universities you can also attend the
career fairs for these universities and
like basically get to know a lot of
people
and because there are a lot of students
in boston it is quite safe you can get
out like at any time of the day and you
will see a lot of people on the road and
it makes you feel safe
boston has a very good public
transportation system as well and most
important thing is that there are a lot
of startups in boston uh and also in the
cities around boston there are a lot of
startups and you have offices of almost
all the big companies there is amazon
there is google so it's easier to
network with people and find jobs if you
get an internship it is quite easier
because you you usually you don't have
to move out of boston so i think that is
like
the biggest pro for northeastern and
um it's not it's not in a suburban area
it's a city area but it's not as
crowded as new york
it's an amazing city i love boston and a
missing post is so much right
anyway so the next um role i would say
is the core program of northeast and i
don't think i have to tell you about
this but northeastern as a co-op program
um
like if you do this co-op program you
can do a co-op which from duration which
like a co-op with a duration of either
four months six months or eight months
so let's say that uh like usually the
co-op program is in cycles okay
so you are allowed to do a co boundary
uh you complete
two semesters
so after your two semesters you can
either do uh you can either start a
co-op in summer and do it like through
the entire fall till december or you can
do a co-op of six months or you can also
do an internship or a four-month co-op
so it gives you a lot of flexibility and
let's say if you do not find an
internship during summer you can search
for an internship during the fall and
let's see if you do not find an
internship during the fall you can also
search throughout the fall for a co-op
that starts during the spring so i think
this is a very big advantage because in
other universities you can only do a
summer internship um but in northeastern
you get three chances so like you can
either search for an internship during
summer fall or spring
so that is amazing and the core program
also gives you like a lot of experience
uh basically you're working in the
company for six months or eight months
so
and also this is like paid co-op so
you're going to earn a lot you're going
to be able to pay your semester fees
you're going to like network with all
the people in the company so it there's
a good chance that you're going to end
up getting a full time in that same
company so i think this is very good
because you gain um like the industry
exposure in the united states
so the co-op program in northeastern is
amazing uh northeastern has a site
called this new works where
all the co-ops are like listed out and
you can apply to these co-ops and we
also get a co-op advisor like every
student will have a co-op advisor and
the scope advisor helps you with
reviewing your resume uh they also help
you with preparing for interviews they
take your mock interviews they just
guide you throughout like with the
applications and everything they help
you with the cpt and uh like before like
you can actually go for a co-op you have
to take a co-op course and in this co-op
course we are taught how to
uh like make a resume how to talk to
people how to prepare a pitch so that
you can go and net career fairs and
network so all these facilities are
provided by northeastern uh not only
that but we also have a career design
center i think most of the universities
in the us have it but northeastern also
has it so you can schedule appointments
with them and they will guide you
one-on-one with your resume
and you know just preparing your
interviews and cover letters and stuff
like that so that is another like a very
very very big pro i would say for
northeastern and this was the only
reason that i chose northeastern uh it
it was for the co-op program
then the third
one i would say were the research
opportunities the northeastern has a
really good research opportunity so i'm
not someone who's into research but um
like we have this um research center and
most of the professors are into reason
so you have to approach the professors
and if your research work in the past
matches with the current research work
then they will interview you um like
after selecting your resume there will
be an interview and then you get an
opportunity to opportunity to research
with them so if you are into research
northeastern has really amazing research
opportunities and i have also read on
the website that northeastern uh carries
out some research in collaboration with
students from uh harvard so
again that's a really good opportunity
to interact with people from harvard and
get into these research programs um so
if you ask me how to get into these
programs and stuff i have no idea
because i have never
tried to
get into research
then i would say
there are a lot of international
students in north northeastern like the
percentage of international students is
pretty high
so you do not feel out of place when you
come over here because everyone around
you is going through the same thing
everyone is struggling with homesickness
um and it's like we are in the same boat
so it's quite relatable and it's good to
make friends
and
yeah it's so it's good like it's quite
good the environment is really nice in
northeastern and also
most of the international students are
indians
so you'll you'll really find people from
your own hometown
and
yeah so i think that's
a pro
uh but if you come to the cons
then
i am going to consider this as a con
like a lot of international students
um mainly a con because it's like you
come
to northeastern
hoping that you will network with people
with different cultures but
everyone around here is
an international student and most of
them are from india
so
it's like
you just feel like you're
in india
and
also there's a lot of competition
because of that because
everyone is trying to get these jobs
that provide cpd everyone is trying to
get the on campus jobs so there's a lot
of competition because there are a lot
of international students and most of
the international students are indians
even during course selection
like whenever the course registration
goes out all the courses are full all
the classes are full in like three
seconds
so
there's always competition
between the students in northeastern
because uh like there are a lot of
students
so which comes to the second con of
northeastern which is the high intake so
ever since after covert northeastern has
really increased the intake and there
are like 500 to 300 students in a badge
i mean in a class there are about 80
students or 60 students or 45 students
but in a batch like if you consider the
information systems total batch it will
be around 500 to 700
and this this is creating a lot of
problems for all of the students because
we are not able to find proper housing
and
not only the housing but
the rents are increasing because
obviously the demand for housing is more
so the rents are increasing um we even
if you find a on-campus job you do not
get complete 20 hours in that on campus
shop so a student has to do multiple
on-campus jobs in order to complete 20
hours and only if you complete 20 hours
then you'll be able to manage your
living expenses with the money that you
want from on campus and then even for
course selection so usually
like everyone wants to follow the same
path like we talk to our seniors and
then our seniors suggest uh suggest us
to take like abc course in the first
semester so everyone wants to go for
that abc course then the course uh like
we are not able to find the uh like
desired courses during that right
semester so i think this is a major con
of northeastern because
it's like you're in a competition to
first get into northeastern then once
you get into northeastern there is a
competition to
get your desired course then again there
is a competition to get there on every
job so it's like you're constantly
competing and it's
kind of crowded so now these students
are high intake
and yeah we'll always have to compete to
get what you want
then i would say another con is
boston
i know this was a pro that
northeastern is in like the main campus
of northeastern is in boston
and i'm going to concentrate on boston
because
i study in boston
um boston is a con because it's quite
expensive when it comes to rent the rent
is goes from around 850 to 1500 per
person for a private room if you want a
shared room then obviously it can go
lower but um like now that i am in san
diego and um like the other suburb that
i'm going to so they have private rooms
starting from 6 50 700 per month so
that's quite good right but not easton
um does not have um
campus housing that is cheap the
on-campus housing in northeastern is
like 1700 and i think that is because it
is in boston boston is quite expensive
even the groceries
and everything else everything is in
boston is very expensive so
you will end up spending a lot and the
monthly
budget is going to be around like eight
fifty two thousand dollars depending
upon how much you eat and how is your
lifestyle
so that is a major con
and not only boston is expensive but
also northeastern is quite expensive the
tuition fees in northeastern is
it so much it is so much
like we have to pay 1 600 and something
i could don't i don't remember the exact
number but yeah we have to be 1 600
something per credit
and you have to take nine credits per
semester
so after like during the first semester
you'll pay like 15 lakh something
including the
health insurance and everything else but
from the second semester your fees will
be around 13 to 14 lakh
so this is quite expensive
so this 13 to 14 lakh was an indian
rupees by the way so this is quite
expensive for
an indian student
so that i'll say that's a really major
con in northeastern and even if you
work on campus you are going to
on
like enough to cover your rent
and if you if you do 20 hours then you
might be able to cover their entire
expenses but if not then you will only
cover your end
then
uh
yeah i think that
i have covered most of the cons in
northeastern
the major one was like the
you know on-campus job
yeah another con is that on-campus jobs
so it's quite difficult to find on
campus jobs in northeastern so all the
international students they hope that
they get an on campus shop because it
just helps you cover your living
expenses but in northeastern it's very
difficult to get an on-campus job and
let me tell you all these on-campus jobs
work through reference so if you know
someone who is working in a particular
position they will refer you and then
you will get an on-campus job but if
you're someone who doesn't know anyone
in northeast northeastern it is quite
difficult to land on an on-campus job
and even if you get an on-campus job
then it's very difficult to get 20 hours
um
so this is like a never-ending story and
i can continue to rant about it for an
hour
because i have tried to
like get another on-campus job and it's
been forever
so that's that's the thing in
northeastern
you do not land an on-campus job easily
it takes a lot of time
and arizo is like the most popular on
campus job in northeastern but even if
you get arrows so you have to you know
keep checking that portal and so that
you can pick up shifts because you're
usually assigned only four to eight
hours of shifts
um so yeah that's it um so these are the
like pros and cons and not these things
and
yeah this was a quite short video
um i tried to think of other pros and
other cons but i think
uh it would be generalized to all the
universities in the united states in the
united states and i just wanted to stay
specific for northeast
so yeah this was all for today's video
bye
