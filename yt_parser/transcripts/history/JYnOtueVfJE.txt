contribute to making Gujarat a global
leader in green growth we will help
Gujarat Target to meet half of its
energy need through renewable energy by
the year

the dirai Amani green energy Giga

jamnagar this will generate a large
number of green jobs and enable
production of green products and
materials and will make Gujarat a
leading exporter of green products and

the world does not yet have this will
make Gujarat a global leader in Digital
Data platforms and AI adoption 5G

gujarat's economy more productive more
efficient and more globally competitive

employment opportunities it will produce
AI enabled doctors AI enabled teachers

revolutionize Health Care education and
agricultural productivity in the state

Gujarati in urban as well as rural areas
