All right, I'm going to go in here.
Even as I'm stepping through these doors
I don't fully grasp
what we're about to walk into.
And suddenly
you're hit
with the intense gaze of dozens
locking onto you.
These men, described
as the worst of the worst,
tattooed with reminders
of El Salvador's dark past.
It's tense and uncomfortable.
But here, officials say comfort
isn't meant to exist.
There's no mattresses, there's no sheets.
You've got a toilet over here
for them to go to the bathroom.
You've got this basin here
that they use to bathe themselves.
And then you can see there
there's a barrel
of water that they can drink from.
This is a rare look inside El Salvador's
terrorism confinement center
known as cigar.
And he says
there's always somebody standing here
in front of the cells.
And then if you look up,
there's another corridor
with more security personnel
The prison sits like an isolated fortress
nestled in mountainous terrain
about an hour and a half drive
from the capital.
Even with government officials on board
with us, we're stopped a mile out.
Okay.
He's going to inspect bags now to.
Okay.
We're clear to get back in.
Only to hit another checkpoint.
Approaching the main gate,
our cell signals vanish.
They want to do a full search on us
before we enter.
Scott's director,
Palomino Garcia, greets us
and takes us through a rigorous
security check. Wedding ring.
So this is, like
airport security on steroids.
Anything that we're carrying with us.
More likely, they left. Okay.
anything we're carrying with us
has to go there.
And then there's a body scan
that continues on the other side.
I got.
Okay. Shoes off.
So I'm back on.
Gracias.
See the total.
Once cleared,
we tour the vast campus,
starting with the armory.
He says they have to constantly
remind themselves
that they're dealing with
essentially the worst of the worst.
And for that reason,
they need to be ready for whatever risks
they might face.
It's been equated
to seven football stadiums.
That's almost multiple prisons
within the prison.
You can see off to the distance
there's three different rings
as they describe the far end.
You have one
that's nine meters high of concrete.
And then above that
three meters
of electrified fencing,
that's 15,000V, 15,000V.
More than a thousand security personnel,
guards.
Police and military
are stationed on site.
Inmates are assigned
to one of eight sectors.
The director tells me the inmates,
once they're inside one of the sectors,
they never leave.
Everything is done within,
including doctors,
as well
as legal visits or court hearings.
Each sector holds
more than two dozen large cells.
Roughly 80 inmates per cell,
but it can fluctuate.
Most bare the markings of the gangs
that held this nation hostage
for decades,
committing brutal acts of violence.
You got to kill people.
You got to rob.
You got to do what
you got to do to survive.
You have to do those things.
Yeah, you got to do that.
And if you didn't do those things,
you wouldn't.
You want to be a gangbanger?
We meet 41 year old Marvin Vasquez,
shackled and heavily guarded.
What gang were you part of?
Ms13.
And do you have any gang affiliations?
Yeah, I'm tattooed up.
I just remember the names.
What is this crazy criminal say?
Crazy criminal?
Yeah.
I made this click in 2011.
You made the click? Yeah.
You were a gang leader.
Yeah.
What is it like to to live here?
It's probably not a hotel five star, but
they give you the three times the food.
They give you some programs you go to.
You got to do exercise
for some church or religion programs to.
But that's limited to just 30 minutes
a day.
The other 23.5 hours,
they're kept inside and locked up
for inmates who get violent
with other prisoners or guards.
Instead of the protocols.
We're going to close the door.
I just want to get a sense of.
Wow.
Solitary confinement awaits.
The only light
you can see through this hole.
And they can be in here for
15 days, potentially.
All right,
I'm ready to get out the.
Critics point specifically
to the prison's strict control
and isolation of inmates,
calling it a violation of human rights.
The director brought up
that a lot of folks will raise concerns
from a human rights perspective
and an abuse of human rights,
that he's come hearing that
because he sees it day to day.
The process
they go through to maintain,
as he sees it, proper punishment
while you're cut off from society here.
Whispers of life on the outside
make their way in.
I've heard about it
that it's a new El Salvador.
It looks different
that new El Salvador has emerged
under President Nayib Bukele,
who took office in 2019 and declared
a controversial state of emergency
more than two years ago.
It sparked an aggressive
crackdown on crime.
We see that firsthand as some
2500 police and soldiers
deploy into one neighborhood.
It's going to go on through the night.
For however long it takes
for them to root out
any suspected criminal elements.
Late last week, as the U.S.
State Department lowered its travel
advisory for El Salvador,
citing a significant reduction in crime,
it also warned that Bukele's
emergency measures
allow authorities to arrest
anyone suspected
of gang activity
and suspends constitutional rights.
Juan Carlos tells me
he was wrongfully held for five months
at a lower security prison
earlier this year.
He says the poor conditions
led to an infection in his leg.
He said he was lumped in
and assumed to be part of a gang.
And he said, in part
because of how he looked.
He had long
hair, said he had a long beard
and he says he has tattoos,
but he points out that for him
these are just artistic expressions.
They have nothing to do
with being part of a gang.
the administration has acknowledged
that innocent people
have been swept up in the crackdown,
and they say more than 7000
have already been released.
They see it as collateral damage.
And Juan Carlos,
while frustrated with the tactics,
believes under Bill Kelly
his country is safer.
Is this headquarters for you guys?
Yes. Okay. Yes.
For Kelly,
security minister targets
gangs with an academic like approach.
I urge you, have a book.
Is it true? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
And this is a book
that has the markings of gang members,
the marks.
The minister compiling his findings
from his nearly 30 years
in law enforcement
to help interpret gang symbols.
Wow.
These three dots,
it says, signify
three things to the gang members
that they have
three destinations,
essentially jail, hospital or cemetery.
From his office,
he monitors crime
reports in real time
and keeps tabs on his officers
in the field.
You can say, you know,
if there's a particular officer
that's in an area that's in question,
why were you there so long?
What are you doing?
And you can hold them accountable,
you know.
He says the program they've built
has started to incorporate AI,
which can tell them where you have to put
your police officer.
And yet
most we meet seem
unfazed by the added show of force,
the same difficulty.
I asked him, I said,
how do you feel with all these soldiers?
I mean, there's a couple of dozen just
I mean, right outside his door.
And he said, I feel safe.
I sat next to George
Moran on my flight in.
His family fled El Salvador civil war
when he was three.
Just coming to the airport.
You you feel the sense of, like, safety,
you know, because you feel it in the US.
No, you don't know.
And you live in Indiana. Yes, sir.
George fully supports President Kelly,
as do most arriving passengers.
It seems,
and folks are actually stopping
to get their pictures
taken between President and First lady.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Under a state of emergency,
law enforcement have arrested
more than 81,000 people.
El Salvador now has one of
the world's highest incarceration rates.
Most end up in facilities like these,
where they can work
to reduce their sentences for
the most hardened criminals, though,
brought to court,
where inside, a life sentence awaits.
We did bad things.
We paid the rough way.
Do time.
And yet, for many on the outside,
the prison now a symbol of newfound
freedom,
the new El Salvador as they see it.
