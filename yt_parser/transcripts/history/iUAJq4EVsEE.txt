in
India but also export to Japan and
European
countries
secondly to expand our V production in
future Suzuki gloup will invest
3200 CR rupes in Suzuki motor guat to
add a new Force production
line which can produce 2.5 lakh unit per

production capacity of Suzuki motor G
from the current 7.5 lakh to 1 million
unit thirdly we will invest 35,000 CL
rupes
for the construction of a second car
plant in

Modi my esteemed

childhood Gujarat is your matumi and
Gujarat should always remain your
Kumi today let me declare yet again
Reliance Wass is and will always remain
a Gujarati
company each of reliance's business is
striving to fulfill the dreams of my
seven CR fellow
gujaratis Reliance has
invested
over 150 billion that is 12 lakh crores
in creating worldclass assets and
capacities across India in the last 10
years of this more than onethird has
been invested in Gujarat
alone honorable chief minister S bendra
Patel G today I would like to make five
commitments to the people of Gujarat
First Reliance will continue to play a
leading role in gujarat's growth story
with significant investments in the next
10
years specifically Reliance will
contribute to making Gujarat a global
leader in green growth we will help
Gujarat Target to meet half of its
energy need through renewable energy by
the year
2030 for this we have started building
the dirai Amani green energy Giga
complex over 5,000 acres in
jamnagar this will generate a large
number of green jobs and enable
production of green products and
materials and will make Gat a leading
exporter of green products and we are
ready to commission this in the second
half of 2024
itself second Reliance Geo completed the
fastest rollout of 5G infrastructure
anywhere in the world today Gujarat is
fully 5G enabled something that most of
the world does not yet have this will
make Gujarat a global leader in Digital
Data platforms and AI adoption 5G
enabled AI Revolution will make
gujarat's economy more productive more
efficient and more globally competitive
besides generating millions of new
employment opportunities it will produce
AI enabled doctors AI enabled teachers
and AI enabled farming which will
revolutionize Health Care education and
agricultural productivity in the state
of Gujarat this will benefit every
Gujarati in urban as well as rural areas
since to my mind AI also means an all
inclusive growth third Reliance retail

bring quality products to Consumers and
simultaneously Empower lacks of kissan
and small Merchants our retail business
improves the quality of life of all
households of Gujarat with better
products and services fourth Reliance

thank you again sir and it's a pleasure
and privilege to be here Jay hind J gar
Gujarat and of course God Bless America
too thank
you thank you very much sir we now
invite Mr nikil Kut co-founder and CFO
zeroda
I only have three minutes today so I
won't waste too much time by talking
about me or setting context
uh picture a 17-year-old boy a school
dropout in Bangalore from 20 years ago
uh not particularly smart not too
educated and no Capital at
hand uh Bangalore from 20 years ago was
a lot quieter uh Greener without the
Vibrance that one might associate with
Bangalore
today the fact that I'm able to stand
here today in front of all of you you uh
people I have idolized for so long that
opportunity to me has been
incredible uh and that to me is the
India
story I often hear people talking about
what India could be 10 years from
now what needs to change or the fact
that we will arrive in 10 years in 5
years or a certain period of time from
today uh
I think we are standing too close to the
trees and not seeing the forest because
the India I am in today that is the
India that to me has already
[Applause]
arrived the opportunities the country
threw to a 17-year-old boy again with no
education no capital or exceptionally
smart uh this in my view has not
happened forever the last 10 years have
been incredible and I'm Not The Only
Exception here in India uh there are
many other exceptions like me uh we all
hang out we call this the startup
ecosystem of
India the big change in India from the
last decade in my opinion also has been
that entrepreneurship has moved from
something that we have all watched
around us heard in uh movies or thought
could as thought Could Happen something
that we aspired to to entrepreneurship
today which is something that is we that
something that we all are actively
trying you could take an example of this
being uh a housewife watching Shark Tank
uh a a smalltime SHO salesman selling
online on flip cart these are not
stories that existed 10 years
[Music]
ago to that one man in the audience here
today uh who in my opinion has
facilitated the stable ecosystem for
people like me to thrive and millions of
other who we call the Youth of India to
thrive uh I would like to say thank you
Modi G for having created this ecosystem
for all of
us
growing up uh I used to talk to people
uh that one relative in my family who
went abroad studied and did very well uh
traveling to the West seemed to be the
the best thing that could happen to
anybody today when I talk to Indians in
the west who have done very well uh the
only thing I hear from them it's a very
young word I call it foro the fear of
Ming up out they're talking about India
as the story that they fear missing out
today that change which has happened in
the last 10 10 years uh is so evident to
see that it makes me feel proud it makes
me feel like I'm in the right place at
the right time and that place today is
[Applause]
India I often ask people if their life
was a book what would they call the
current
chapter uh it's a good question for all
of us to ask ourselves when I look at
India and I ask myself what would be
this chapter in in the book of India the
first word that came up in my mind was
arrived and finally as I stand here in a
room full of politicians diplomats
dignitaries men
mentors I don't look upon this ecosystem
uh as potential uh you know as the way
I'm looking at this today is we are all
potential Partners in a story that could
change the global economic landscape
today and that story is India and to all
the foreign investors here uh India is
seemingly looking like the coolest party
in town I think what you need to be
aware of is if you arrive too late you
might not get in so I'd like to thank
everybody thank Modi G for this
opportunity thank you
everyone thank you very much
sir today we have with us dignitaries
from number of countries we would like
to invite them to share their thoughts
with us

classes that include natural
disasters climate change and
geopolitical tensions from International
cooperation for addressing challenges on
the global scale is taking on greater
importance I wish to express my
admiration for the formid formidable
leadership of Prime Minister Modi who
despite such difficult circumstances
has successfully upheld India's great

other challenges on the worldwide
scale India and Japan are special
strategic Global
Partners Bound By The Universal values
of Freedom democracy
human rights and rule of law that we
have shared over our long history of
exchange being that we are at such
Global turning point I firmly feel that
more than ever the strengthening of
relations between India and Japan in the
economic sector is imperative for the
sake of carving out a sustainable
peaceful future
up to this point Japanese corporations
have continued to invest in the
internation of
India with a cumulative amount of
investment between two 20 2,000 and
2023
reaching 38.3
billion this amount is second in the
world when tax Heavens are
excluded the number of Japanese
corporation that have entered into into
the Indian market and the number of
their Bas basis of operation they have
respectively reached
1,00 and
4800 over time these cooperations have
kept on contributing to the for for
development of India's manufacturing
sector particularly the automotive
field in the state of garat and
Manufacturing industry ecosystem
centered on the four and two oiled
vehicle sectors have been intensively
built
there in order to further accelerate the
making India initiative Japan refuser
tackled the Improvement of the
investment environment through support
for Japanese industrial
parks Gujarat currently hosts six
Japanese style manufacturing schools
where we develop human resources to work
on the manufacturing front
lines we intend to continue Landing our
cooperation in this field going
forward initiatives by Japanese
corporations are also extremely active
to give an example Suzuki has already
produced
750,000 vehicles at its garat based
Factory that it sells all over the world
not just in
India moreover the company has also
adopted a plan to export electric
vehicles produced in Gua to Japan and
Europe in 2025 and
Beyond I feel deep grud toward the
Indian graduate governments for their
cooperation for so
long last July we announced the Japan
India industrial Co creation initiatives
in order to go beyond cooperation in the
automotive industry and other existing
industry domains to create Industries in
the name of a future developing
relations between
our respective Nations as we move
forward in the
semiconductor hydrogen green and digital
domains in particular meta is carrying
out preparation to proactively assist
with business development in
India for cooperation surrounding
semiconductors in July
2023 we executed the Japan India
semiconductor supply chain
partnership and launched the policy
dialogue last November we promptly held
our first meeting of that partnership
which had over 100 individual
representing Japanese semiconduct
related to enterpris the
attendance this time as as well we
carefully selected some semiconductor
cooperations with considerable potential
to contribute to India and asked them to
accompany us here we hope to go beyond
contribution to the establishment of
semiconductor ecosystem in India in the
form of developing semiconductor
manufacturing environment improving the
logistic environment and developing
semiconductor human capital
for the hydrogen domains as well we are
providing support for attracting
Japanese coroporation to India and
lowering the initial risk associated
with the start of oper operations in
order to accelerate cooperation with the
nation in fact World leading equipments
such as water electricity systems and
ammonia mixed combustion burners is in
the process of being introduced in
India in addition M will enact budgetary
measures of million us doar for the
purpose of accelerating economic
cooperation with India our hope is to
develop concrete projects through these
funds toward the future the concept of
vibrant G 2024 is gateway to the Future
let let Japan with its accumulation of
technology and India whose growth is
just beginning join hands in driving
forward the international society and
carving of the future of the world I

honorable prime minister Narendra Modi G
Chief
Minister President your excellencies
ladies and gentlemen and keeping with
the tradition I too can use the phrase B
Oro
brani
Prime Minister Modi G you defined the
living bridge between our United Kingdom
and India and therefore it is
appropriate that I also extend the
greetings of my prime minister Rishi
sunak indeed the son-in-law of bhat the
son-in-law of
India and on this occasion of the 10th
vibrant Gujarat it's my honor to
represent the British government on this
suspicious
occasion this Summit has truly in every
sense served as a masterclass on how to
go about attracting Global Investors to
have a stake in that remarkable growth
which as we've seen captains of industry
line up and say is truly remarkable of
India bat
story our nations may be separated by
thousand thousands of miles
geographically but that vast distance
can diminish with the warmth between our
people that living bridge and there is
so much in common between our two
Nations I'm going to park the whole
theory of cricket for a moment but that
is an important bridge and to those
Nations represented here who don't quite
understand Cricket I assure you we the
UK and India stand together in helping
you understand this great game but
India's leadership and in congratulating
the Prime Minister and indeed the whole
government of India on G20 last year was
a true Testament to its
determination and I'm grateful to my
friend the minister for external Affairs
J Shankar G for your leadership during
that occasion along with Prime Minister
Modi G as
well and I'm really confident prime
minister that this living Bridge or
people and ideas and Innovation will
truly make our partnership a potent
combination for the years ahead and I
just want to reflect briefly on the why
this is India is the second largest
investor in the United Kingdom more than
900 Indian businesses operate in the
United Kingdom Indian FDI in the UK is
growing faster than any other country
and for our part the United Kingdom has
a unique mix of worldclass expertise and
indeed Talent total trade in goods
between our two Nations stands at over
38 billion pound that's close to $50
billion and that's increased in the last
year Alone by
24% and that demonstrates the real
strength between the two Nations the
United Kingdom is the most globally
connected economy in the G20 ranked
second globally for soft power and the
first in the G7 for international
research collaboration and impact and I
know those are important sectors right
here in Gujarat and for India as well
and we've heard already a great deal
about green Finance London is also
number one globally for green finance
and that's why we are truly ambitious we
are excited by the potential of our
partnership with India and in particular
with the state of Gujarat and the United
Kingdom is collaborating on many
exciting projects in how we develop our
relationship with G as we move forward
take for example the statue of unity
designed by UK Architects Arab which now
stands tall
as a symbol of a new confident
India or the G JCB Factory designed by
Mt McDonald whose ma Machinery is now
powering India's incredible
infrastructure
development but prime minister chief
minister we want to go further we want
to do more and of course we understand
the power of education and we're proud
of the strong association between India
and the United Kingdom when it comes to
our education sectors as well when you
power someone an individual no matter
where in the world through education you
Empower them their families their
communities indeed their Nations and I
know Prime Minister Modi G what a
priority this is for you and it is also
live right now we have just signed aou
to enable closer collaboration between
our higher education institutions we
want to go further in the areas of the
creative economy nurturing art artists
and boosting cultural
exchange being no doubt business links
will continue to grow creating jobs and
prosperity whether it's from here in
Ahmedabad to abedine in Scotland in the
United Kingdom our old friendship is
blossoming into a new
partnership Bharat or
britani
it is a true friendship a lasting
friendship a deep friendship and a
binding friendship and partnership for
today and the
future

pleasure to be here ladies and gentlemen
the topic of this Summit is gateway to
the Future it is a big
inspiration we are at a special point
and can choose our future it is a Time
of dramatic risks but also of great
chances because the problems of today
are very complex it is not wise to
concentrate on only one strategy I think
the human Humanity needs to work with
three main priorities three keys to
unlock the Gateway the first key is
innovation and new technologies the
second key is Advanced industry and the
thir key is applied research which
benefits the public like in health and
medicine please let me tell you about
the position of the Czech Republic the
first key is innovation and new
technologies my country is quickly
moving to higher value economy we are
changing our education system and we
want stronger accent we want stronger
Accent on stem subjects we also support
Innovation and partnership between
universities research institution and
private sector maybe you know some
Innovative check brands for example the
software security company Avast or the
online ticketing Global player Ki my
government is mainly interested in
long-term Strategic investment this
includes AI research electromobility and
especially
semiconductors they are key for
High-Tech Industries today from Cars to
mobile phones we also pay close
attention to innovation in the energy
sector unlike many European countries we
believe in the future of nuclear power
we have 50 years of expertise in nuclear
power our top interest is development of
small modular reactors on this way we
want to work with leading Global makers
it is also a chance to improve our Czech
Indian capacities in nuclear energy
research we are very serious about
innovation in renewable energy and green
digital
Technologies the goal is to have
reliable efficient and sustainable
energy this is about clean environment

agriculture the second key to our future
is Advanced industry my country is a
great exporter of high quality
industrial goods I am sure that you know

all sectors of our industry we are proud
of traditional and new products and
their
quality the third key is applied
research in fields like health care and
Medicine

health lifestyle diseases sustainability
of Public Health Systems and the new
health dangers covid-19 is a typical
example it show us the benefits of
international cooperation sharing
results and experience and fighting the

medical science fast Innovation can
bring big benefits to people it's
