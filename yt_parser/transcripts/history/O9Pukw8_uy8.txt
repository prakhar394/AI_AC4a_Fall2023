if you could have one superpow what
would it be superp power uh I'd like to
be smarter uh a local question but what
is your favorite Indian
food
uh I'm supposed to say tea chai chai
chai no Tika chicken Tika
[Applause]
masala
[Music]
fantastic so with that bill we love
rapid fires so we have got Asha Dean
here who's all set to ask ask you a
bunch of questions there's only one rule
one word or one sentence
okay hi it's an honor to speak with you
so as gazel already mentioned this will
be a rapid fire round so just be quick
and short with your answers with that
I'll start with a very simple question
if you could have one superp power what
would it be super power uh I'd like to
be
smarter uh what is your favorite film
about AI or
robots
um uh her um it's called her it's very
good uh which year would you travel to
with the time machine and
[Laughter]
why I don't know I I wouldn't want to go
backwards I don't think uh I I can read
about the stuff from the past but I'm
not sure I want to go forwards either
because it would spoil you know it kind
of uh ruined the plot uh in a way I
don't know I like I like the present
year uh what's the first word you start
with on Wordle first what's the first
word you start with on Wordle oh right
now I use Trace t r a c
e uh a local question but what is your
favorite Indian
food
uh I'm supposed to say tea chai chai
chai no Tika chicken Tika
[Applause]
Masala uh what's one thing on your
bucket list
deal uh go to the Paris
Olympics uh this is a tough one but if
not a technologist or a philanthropist
what career would you have pursued
if you wer a technologist or a
[Music]
philanthropist wow
uh techn it technolog is BR I don't know
I mean my dad was a lawyer and I admired
him a great deal he He Set uh incredible
example for me and he actually helped
start the foundation and when I was very
young uh because my dad I wanted to be a
lawyer uh but then this computer thing
distracted me
uh and now I employ thousands of
[Applause]
lawyers uh if you had to set up
Microsoft today what would you do
differently you know Microsoft
uh we made a lot of mistakes but our
basic idea that software was was magic
and that if we got very good at writing
software we hired better people we had
better tools and we thought of ourselves
as a multi-product software company our
competitors were like Word Perfect had a
word processor Ashton had a database
Lotus had a spreadsheet and we're like
we don't care about individual products
as much we have the best software
Factory in the world and so if something
new comes along we're just like five
times faster than those companies and
because they didn't think broadly they
would never invest in the kind of tools
that that we had and so we could just
outrun uh them you know and
and so we did make a lot of mistakes I
mean uh you know the one I I might
regret the most is that we should have
done the operating system for the phone
so what was called Windows
mobile uh if we hadn't made a few really
bad mistakes would have the position
that Android has today as the standard
OS for all the non-apple phones and you
know I made a lot of those mistakes so I
I feel bad about
it uh so this is a this or that segment
so you have to choose one option okay
this uh so Taj Mahal or Eiffel Tower oh
Taj is more classic
uh uh Super Bowl or FIFA World
Cup no maybe neither for me uh uh so
this is the last question it's a tough
one a life without books or a life
without
technology uh tough one well I'll I'll
give up the physical books since I'll
and read off the screen I guess
uh
