hi everyone
[Music]
hey guys i'm akshada and welcome to
another video so in today's video i am
going to talk about three things so in
the first part we are going to discuss
about why did i apply to so many
universities and in the second part i am
going to talk about why you should not
repeat the same mistake and in the third
part of the video i'll tell you which
universities i had applied to my admits
and my rejects i've added the different
time stamps in the description box below
so please you can skip to the part that
you like and let's start with the video
so i gave my gre in my second semester
of third year
and i scored a 306 so i was aiming for a
score of 310 and above and that's why i
was really disappointed
i decided that i'm going to retake my
gre but in the meantime i joined a
counselling agency to help me with my
application process
so what happens when you join a
counseling agency is that they evaluate
your profile and then they give you a
list of universities that you should
apply to
like based on the profile i already had
researched on my end and i had a list of
universities that i wanted to apply to
so i discussed these universities with
my counselor and she told me that my gre
score is really low for these
universities and i have to score 310 in
my next attempt in order to get an admit
in this universities
so then i gave my second attempt of gre
and
i again scored 306
so again i was really disappointed but
there was not enough time that i could
again retake my gre and i had to give my
il so i just decided that i am going to
go with
the gre score of 306
then i visited some education fairs in
my city and i used to ask them the same
thing like i used to tell them my
profile and used to ask them that what
are the chances of me being admitted
into your university and they used to
reply me with the same thing that your
grt score is low and that is a 50 chance
or there is a 60 chance so due to all
these things i will my confidence was
really low but love i used to think in
my mind that what if i apply to a
certain number of universities and i end
up getting zero admits what then
so because of this fear and uncertainty
i just ended
up applying to
13 universities
i know that's a lot but yeah i applied
to 13 universities
and this time i wanted to do mis so i
applied to 13 universities the course
was mostly mis
then the covet 19 pandemic happened uh
and i was
actually
yeah so after applying to 13
universities i started getting admits
from all these universities i only got
two rejects so i was really happy but
then i was really confused about which
university should i go for it was very
confusing to come to a decision because
i had so many options
then
the kobe 19 pandemic happened and i
decided to defer my admits so i
shortlisted a few universities and i
deferred my admits for these
universities
and in the one year that i had i talked
to the seniors and i talked to the
alumni uh for the universities that i
had shortlisted and also i changed my
mind so i decided that i have to do data
analytics and i don't want to do
management information systems
so in fall 2021 i again applied to four
universities
also in fall 2021 for many universities
the gre score was waved off so i thought
that you know let's just take a chance
so i just applied to some more
universities the in
2021
so in total i ended up applying to 13
plus four universities
so in conclusion i think the reason why
i applied to so many universities was
because i
like i would say that i was not
confident at all about my profile
i was really fearful
then i think there was some lack of
awareness and guidance i used to think
that gre score
is only
the single factor that is going to
affect your uh application decision
so that's the reason that why i ended up
applying to so many universities
now we come to the second point of part
of this video
i've just written down a couple of
points
so i think the first main factor
is that you'll end up spending a lot of
money like really a lot of money
so
you're like there so for some
universities you will get some
application fee papers when you go to
the education
fairs and if you join a counseling
agency so you might think okay
application fee waiver
application
but it's not
the application fee that you have to pay
you have to pay for the gre score you
have to pay for the ielts score to reach
them you have to sometimes pay for the
transcripts uh to reach them so
you know you just end up spending a lot
of money the application fee
costs uh
around like 60 75 sometimes even 90
so during fall 2020 i ended up spending
a huge amount of money just on
applications and that's one reason why
you should not do it
the second reason that i would say is
that
it will create a lot of confusion so let
us say you apply to a lot of
universities and you get admits from a
lot of universities
but now
you will have so many options you will
really be confused about which
university you should go for because uh
you will talk to the people you'll ask
them about the university everyone is
going to have a different perspective
and every university has its own cons
and its own pros so you're just going to
be confused about which is the best
university so i think
that you can just avoid this confusion
by being prepared before applying
and the last point is that
it is a big waste of time and energy so
making an application to the
universities is not is not a small task
you have to write lor you have to write
a sop which is specific for that course
and for that universities so every time
you make a sop you will have to go and
research about that university about the
course about the research and faculty
then you'll have to proofread that sop
then you'll have to fill the application
form so overall it is a very time
consuming process
so i will really recommend you to
not apply to many universities
and i have made a list of some points
that you should consider before applying
to the university universities so the
first and the very main thing is that
you should know your course so like i
you know first i said that i want to do
mis and then i changed my mind so
you should just be sure about what you
want to do
about which course
then the second thing that
you should consider is
you should make a list of two safe
universities two
average universities and two ambitious
universities according to your profile
and i think six universities is really
more than enough and you should be
confident about yourself
you are going to get an admit from the
university just believe that and you
will get an admit from the university
but yes this doesn't mean that you
should just go and apply to any
university and expect an advert
just uh compare your profile with
everyone else and then a shortlist six
universities and then be confident that
you will get an admit
so now we come to the last part of the
video
fall 2020 like i said i applied to 13
universities
so i applied to njit
northeastern university
i applied to pace university then uic i
applied to university of texas at
arlington university of texas at dallas
university of south florida texas a m
university
then
uh what else arizona state university
and yeah red girls i replied to rutgers
as well so and yes oklahoma state
university and colorado state university
as well
so these are the university that i had
applied in fall 2020 and out of all
these universities i was accepted in all
of them except for texas a m and
university of south florida
then in fall 2021 i again applied to
northeastern university but
a different course and in northeastern
university so there are two colleges cps
and coe so i applied to coe and a
different course
and then i applied to university of
south florida because i really really
like their course
but they rejected me both the times
and i applied to university of minnesota
twin cities because the gre was waved
off
and i again i applied to arizona state
university but a different program as
compared to fall 2021
and university of texas at dallas so
i applied to university of texas at
dallas because it didn't defer my admit
the last time
and out of this i was rejected from
university of minnesota and university
of south florida and i was accepted from
all the other universities
so i hope that you learn something from
my experience and
you prepare well before making your
applications and that is the reason why
