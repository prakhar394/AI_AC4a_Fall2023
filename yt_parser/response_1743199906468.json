    "transcript": "what you see behind me is the world's\nstrictest and largest prison this Mega\nprison has a capacity of 40,000\nprisoners here are the most unsafe\npeople you can even imagine how many\npeople's lives have you ended is it five\nor 10 how many more than 50 MS13 and\nmany other gangs these are animals these\naren't people they're Psychopaths\nsociopaths the kind of people we have\nhere we are about to see the burst of\nthe burst welcome to C the world's\nlargest prison by capacity in El Vador\nwhich was constructed to imprison the\nhighest profile criminals those who\nenter this prison are destined never to\nleave alive there's no way out how you\ngoing to come out of this the reason why\nthis small country of 6 million needs\nthe largest prison is the\ngangs once dominating the country these\ngangs faced a dramatic Crackdown\nstarting in March\n2022 under President naib bu's\nAdministration over 70,000 individuals\nabout 2% of the country's adult\npopulation were arrested within just 16\nmonths buses transported thousands of\nchange gang members to seot in a tightly\ncoordinated nighttime\noperation sitting one behind the other\nheads lowered they looked like a single\nMass surrounded by armed guards none of\nthem dared to resist\ncommands their life has changed in a day\nin this docu umentary we will interview\none of them one of the most ruthless\ngang leaders known by the nickname\nPsycho 10 minutes you only have 10\nminutes built in 2022 this massive\nprison is made up of eight separate\nmodules spread over 410 acres of land\neach pair of modules is enclosed by two\nseparate 3 m High walls with razor wire\nthe entire facility is surrounded by a\ntowering 9 M high wall with a 3 m High\nelectric fence carrying 15,000 volts 19\nWatchtower are ensuring nothing escapes\nnotice the entire design doesn't just\nprevent Escape it erases the very idea\nof it hello hello we have permission\nfrom the\npresidency the solders stopped us we're\nhoping this will be the last checkpoint\nthe Jammers blocked all signals within a\n2 km radius of secot completely cutting\noff all communication over 600 soldiers\nwork only to secure the\nperimeter we are going to leave all of\nour belongings here before entering the\nprison we will only carry our cameras\nand microphones that's it pass\nslowly look at the\ncamera the body SC I forgot my wedding\nring off well that needs to be put away\nover there this high capacity X-Ray\nScanner even shows bones and internal\norgans it's mainly used to scan\nnewcomers ensuring no one tries to sneak\nin anything forbidden on their body\nbefore entering the inmates used to\nswallow some objects\nor they would try to bring them inag or\nmicro SD memory cards microchips and not\nonly that even phone charges another\nthorough body search has been\nconducted take off your\nshoes they even inspected inside our\nsocks it took us around 1 hour just to\npass through security even though we\nwere invited as media after months of\napplying guards are wearing masks\nbecause they're doing a risky job here\nso if they get identified it might be\nriskier for them to go to town centers\nbecause these gangs they have a lot of\nconnections so they have to keep their\nidentity secret why don't you wear a\nmask I have to talk to them face to face\nlooking them in the eye they already\nknow who I am we're in the registration\nroom this area is for inmates only when\na criminal is captured on the street\nthey don't carry ID or give their real\nname that's why their fingerprints and\nphotographs are taken here to enroll in\nthe\nsystem once they become a permanent part\nof seot the inmates lose all contact\nwith loved ones for the rest of their\nlives as family visits are strictly\nforbidden it's also important to note\nthat a small number of innocent people\nwere mistakenly imprisoned during the\nbig Crackdown because of the no contact\npolicy their families have no idea where\nthey are or if they are still alive\nthrough some this documentary could be\ntheir first chance to see a missing\nloved one before entering the modules\nwhere the inmates are we visit the\nArmory of the prison this section is on\nmust in case of possible riots and these\nconvicts are the most unsafe people on\nEarth the type of firearm we use is a\nt65 rifle similar to the M16\nrifle we also have this other firearm\nwhich is a 12 gauge\nshotgun a 6our rifle allows us to\nmaneuver in spaces that are too tight to\nmove whenever criminals are arrested and\ndragged to the bus various cuffs and\nchains are used to restrict their\nmovements and minimize the risk of of\nharm to officers has there ever been a\nriot int so far there have been No\nEscape attempts we have the worst of the\nworst within criminal organizations here\nthe riot gear consists of a head\nprotection a face shield neck protection\nan anti-t truma vest leg protectors shin\nguards and of course a\nshield generally in the\nprisons inmates invent any kind of\nhandmade weapon like all or knives they\nare fully protected you can see how\nprotects his feet since this prison is\nso large we have to hop on this\nbus we are entering the module area to\nkeep the country safe 1,000 staff\nmembers work inside SE it is impossible\nbut let's just imagine that an inmate\nget out of the Fortress these Pebbles\nthat you see are put here intentionally\nbecause when they walk on these Pebbles\nit works like an alarm system it makes a\nnoise they cannot sneak away have they\ntried to escape no did they try\ndifficult because they would have to go\nthrough a series of security Rings seot\nwas built with its own infrastructure in\nan isolated area including an electrical\nand sewage system to prevent external\ninterference in case of an electricity\ncut or water supply issue the systemns\nand power plants will maintain\noperations for up to a week I'm so\nexcited we're going to be face to face\nwith the most dangerous criminals in the\nworld it is pretty tense we are entering\none of the modules now you are seeing\nthe third and fourth modules next to\neach other an offender who enters one of\nthese buildings never exits through\nthese\ndoors in a few steps we'll be surrounded\nby more than 2,500\ninmates it's like stepping in the middle\nof Controlled Chaos\n[Music]\nthis is so intense their eyes are all on\nme following my every step getting an\neye contact with\nthem there are there are so many of\nthem and\nspeechless I can't help but feel honees\nall of them wear white shirts shorts and\nslippers they don't have any other\nbelongings most are barely out of their\nearly 20s and convicted of serious\noffenses even the most most infamous\ncriminals in history have an average of\n20 to 30 proven victims but here some of\nthe inmates are responsible for hundreds\nof innocent people's lives can I ask the\ninmates something no no no if you have\nany questions I can answer them for you\nif they try to communicate with me now\nwhat are you going to do I'm not going\nto allow them they know from them that\nsubsequently there may be a penalty for\nnot abiding by an instruction I'm\ncurious to know which of these group\nleaders I'll be interviewing it is\nforbidden for us to pass this year\nyellow line because these are one of the\nmost dangerous human beings on Earth\nwithout the bars between us everyone\nknows exactly what could happen there\nare 32 cells in every one of the eight\nmodules making up the mega prison each\ncell holds around 80 inmates but the\nnumber can go as high as 150 despite not\nbeing at full capacity the inmates only\nhave .5 squ M of personal space each\nprisoners do not have any ventilation\nrights or Courtyards to walk outside\ntheir cell each inmate here have been\ngiven one of the longest sentences you\ncan even imagine in your life the only\nthing that doesn't change that all these\ninmates will never get outside they will\nnever see sunlight the only people are\nauthorized to get inside and outside are\nthe personnel and sometimes media like\nus they will never ever leave this\nbuilding if you see their look you can\nsee the emptiness in their soul they\ndon't have any hope towards future they\nlook very robotic their life is so\nmonotone this open corner is their\ntoilet\narea they have like two toilets for 80\ninmates it's literally humiliating these\ninmates like their whole confidence is\ndisciplined here the same place where\nthey use the toilet is also where they\ntake showers to clean themselves they\nuse plastic Dippers in a single shared\nBasin there's no running water in the\ncells so the prisoners have to rely on\none blue barrel for drinking water where\nthey sleep is these metal bunks no\npillow no mattress each prisoner\nreceives just the Bare Essentials a\nwhite sheet a uniform socks slippers and\na towel that's it the prisoners spend\ntheir entire days on their four-level\nbunk beds they have stacked tightly like\nitems stored in a warehouse as part of\nhygiene in order inmates are shaved\nevery 2 weeks by Personnel long hair or\nbeards aren't just unhygienic they can\nalso hide sharp objects let's take a\nlook take off your shirt and line up\nhere now they are taking their shirts\noff\nthese inmates were once part of the MS13\nand bario 18 gangs which controlled the\nneighborhoods of El Salvador these two\nrival gangs spent years extorting money\nfrom locals and causing great suffering\nto Salvadorans there is bar 18 MS13\ngangs all together in one cell that's\nright just like that the entire module\nis the same they all live like this\noutside entering each other's\nneighborhood could mean being torn apart\nyet here they are side by side until\ntheir last breath how do they live\nwithout attacking one another they have\nto learn how to live together here they\nare in a prison they are not on the\nstreet most of the inmates have tattoos\ncovering their entire bodies even\nincluding their faces showing their\nloyalty structure for MS13 tattoos often\ninclude initial letters or the number 13\nmembers of the other gang use symbols\nlike 18 or 666 which add up to 18 and\nsymbolize the devil or they use Roman\nnumerals having gang tattoos on one's\nface is a clear sign that they are one\nof the most ruthless and high ranking\nmembers of the organization crossing\npaths with such a person on the street\nis the same as staring death in the face\na spiderweb tattoo represents being\ncaught in the web of justice and serving\na long prison sentence the devil Horn's\ntattoo was a dark symbol that represents\nthese individuals worship of the devil\nsome even claim that They carried out\ntheir actions under the devil's command\na teardrop tattoo signifies that the\nperson has ended someone's life the\nnumber of teardrops indicates how many\nlives they've taken if there are three\nteardrops it suggests that the tattoos's\nowner has taken so many lives that\nthey've lost count with the phrase laugh\nnow cry later these masks or clown\ntattoos send a clear message stay strong\nin the face of hardship now and deal\nwith the consequences later are all\nthese people truly bad they're on\nanother level high-profile criminals who\nwill never change their\nmentality if you look at the upside\nthere's a catwalk area guards can\nconsistently watch over the inmates from\nthis elevated spot above the cells if\nanything suspicious occurs they will\nintervene while an extensive network of\ncameras observes every corner 24/7\nensuring nothing goes unnoticed the\nmodules are kept lit all day and night\nfor monitoring When the Sun Goes Down\nthe Lights stay on all the time they are\nconstantly being observed I think this\nis one of the hardest things when they\ntry to sleep they use their towels and\ncover their eyes to block the light\npreacher here is teaching some of the\nimportant lessons from the Bible to the\ninmates they're doing physical exercise\nover here there's the trainer there this\nis the only time these inmates get out\nof their celles these activities take\nplace for a total of 1 hour per week\nunder the watch of armed guards for the\nrest of the time they are locked inside\nthey used to control the streets now\nthey can't even take a step with their\nfree will it's a rotating schedule\nthere's not enough space so they can't\nall go out on the same day has there\never been a CTIC incident when the IM\nwere outside of their cells so far\nnothing whenever we focus the camera on\na cell we often catch a prisoner\nsilently mouthing words even Behind Bars\ngang members attempt to send orders to\nthe outside this prisoner was doing just\nthat but we censored him to block the\nmessage despite the Crackdown these\ngroups still hold significant power\noutside rumors suggest they have plans\nfor taking Revenge by targeting innocent\npeople but in response the authorities\nthreatened to impose even harsher\nmeasures on impr prison's members if\nthey do that there won't even be one\nmeal in prison I swear to God they won't\neat a grain of rice let's see how long\ntheir homeb last inside here they get\nthree meal times breakfast lunch and\ndinner breakfast is usually beans and\nrice for lunch they get white rice and\npasta and dinner's pretty much the same\nthe only thing that changes is the\ndrink there's no nutritious food like\nchicken or meat this is the lunch\nit's rice pasta and two tortillas does\nthe menu vary from day to day no is it\nthe same every day it's always the same\nit's for freshman\nokay this a sugary drink I'm going to\ntaste it for myself inmates must eat\nwith their hands and clean their plates\nbefore returning them with a diet\nlacking in protein many likely suffer\nfrom nutritional deficiencies before\nstarting our interview with an inmate I\nwant to show you one more place that is\neven more extreme than what you've seen\nso\nfar here we are in the isolation cell\narea if inmates break a rule they can be\nsent to these isolation cells according\nto the\nlegislation the law gives me the right\nto keep the prisoners in isolation for\nup to 15 days these cells have sealed\ndoors through this grid I can see them\nand identify who's\ninside we serve food here and we also\nuse this space to put handcuffs on them\nbefore opening the door to move them\nfrom here to their\ncell welcome to the isolation cell if an\ninmate misbehaves this is where he ends\nup he won't know the time or how much\nlonger he'll be kept inside for days or\neven weeks he sleeps on this concrete\nbed without ever leaving they are cut\noff from the outside world left alone\nwith nothing but their\nthoughts this is where they Supply their\nwater there's a water bin here they take\ntheir water here and this is where they\npee the Basin for drinking water in the\ntoilets are located side by side the\ntoilet looks recently used and dirty\nsuggesting that this cell has recently\nbeen used the only light they have is\nthis little hole that barely lets the\nsunshine in this openness is also the\nsole source of fresh\nair what is the most challenging thing\nabout isolation room according to you\ninside you don't even see your hands so\nwhen someone is isolated it is necessary\nfor them to have something a book\nanything to keep their mind clear but\nhere they don't have access to any of\nthat no matter how tough a criminal is\nthis kind of isolation breaks them this\nis necessary for the type of offenders\nthat we have here people who once played\nGod by deciding who would live and who\nwouldn't live deserve the worst\npunishment we don't show them Mercy they\ncan ask for forgiveness and may God\nforgive them but here Justice must be\nserved for so many victims and it's the\nleast they deserve we're going to\ninterview the inmate known as psycho he\nhas a 34-year criminal history and has\nspent the last 25 years as a high\nranking member of an organization 10\nminutes you only have 10 minutes 12\nguards are barely enough to ensure the\nsafety around this inmate remove the\nmask what is your name my name is Marvin\nErnesto metano Vasquez how old are you\nI'm 41 years old you don't look 41 you\nlook younger like 35 that's a good thing\nthat you told me cuz I I feel old can I\nsee your\ntattoos M 13 when did you join this\ncrime organization in 2004 but I started\nmy criminal record since I was 11 years\nold how did you first become involved\nwhen somebody's born with just a mom and\nthe mom is working you look for the\nstreets you look for somebody to help\nyou out I said W my mom's poor I need\nsome shoes I need some clothes and I\nstarted robbing then I need a father\nfigure cuz I didn't grow up with my\nfather and then I I looked the group of\ngangs then I did a a side and I came\nright here to a Salvador trying to\nchange my life but I think that there\nmore gangs right here and I started\ndoing the same thing I did Upstate and I\ngot locked up I always been one of them\npersons that wanted to accomplish the\nthings that they put in their mind and I\naccomplished everything I had to do\nright here but I'm right here this is\nhow the devil pays the people yeah is it\ntrue that to join this crime\norganization you need to end someone's\nlife yeah but but the first one must be\none of your relatives right yeah yeah\ncuz you got to gain territory for your\ngang I lost my mom my dad my son\neverything right here because of the\ngangs by when I could be with my family\nhey Upstate the United States a better\nlife but you know we took wrong\ndecisions and this is the cause of this\nthat's why I tell the youth hey go to\nschool listen to your mom listen to your\ndad don't live this life that we live\nright here there's no way out how many\npeople's lives ended is it five or 10\nhow many no if you talk about what you\nused to do in the jails after it\nprobably get get a few more than\n[Music]\n50 you got to do it sometimes how did\nyou become cold blooded and merciless in\ntime I can't really respond you with\nthat question how do you feel about not\nseeing your family forever since you're\ninout I feel bad cuz I I seen my son the\nthe last time when he was 5 years old\nand I'm I'm he's 21 years old

I cry what is\nyour motivation to stay alive here to\none day change my life life and look for\nGod in my life and and I tell God hey\nforgive me forgive me cuz I did some\nthings\nokay finally we see the sunlight\nhonestly seat is a place you would never\nwish to end up in even as a visitor but\nfor the people who victimize Salvadorans\nit is now their forever home these\ncriminals took the innocent people's\nright to live and now they're paying for\nit the Salvadorian government's message\nis clear crime is no longer tolerated\nand the punishment is severe El Salvador\nonce had the highest rate of lives loss\ndue to widespread chaos during its peak\n104 out of every 100,000 people lost\ntheir lives in a single year previous\nadministrations agreed to atuse with\nthese groups but this couldn't bring\nlasting order although the current\ngovernment's methods are controversial\nby 2023 the number dramatically dropped\nto 2.4 per 100,000 people placing Al\nSalvador among the safest countries in\nthe world for the first time so far the\nresults are undeniable peace has\nreturned to the neighborhoods but what\nabout those who were wrongfully\nimprisoned is it true Justice or way to\ncontrol chaos are we seeing a lasting\nsolution or just a temporary fix for now\nthe answer remains unclear and the world\ncontinues to watch thank you for\nwatching this documentary see

    "transcript": "All right, I'm going to go in here.\nEven as I'm stepping through these doors\nI don't fully grasp\nwhat we're about to walk into.\nAnd suddenly\nyou're hit\nwith the intense gaze of dozens\nlocking onto you.\nThese men, described\nas the worst of the worst,\ntattooed with reminders\nof El Salvador's dark past.\nIt's tense and uncomfortable.\nBut here, officials say comfort\nisn't meant to exist.\nThere's no mattresses, there's no sheets.\nYou've got a toilet over here\nfor them to go to the bathroom.\nYou've got this basin here\nthat they use to bathe themselves.\nAnd then you can see there\nthere's a barrel\nof water that they can drink from.\nThis is a rare look inside El Salvador's\nterrorism confinement center\nknown as cigar.\nAnd he says\nthere's always somebody standing here\nin front of the cells.\nAnd then if you look up,\nthere's another corridor\nwith more security personnel\nThe prison sits like an isolated fortress\nnestled in mountainous terrain\nabout an hour and a half drive\nfrom the capital.\nEven with government officials on board\nwith us, we're stopped a mile out.\nOkay.\nHe's going to inspect bags now to.\nOkay.\nWe're clear to get back in.\nOnly to hit another checkpoint.\nApproaching the main gate,\nour cell signals vanish.\nThey want to do a full search on us\nbefore we enter.\nScott's director,\nPalomino Garcia, greets us\nand takes us through a rigorous\nsecurity check. Wedding ring.\nSo this is, like\nairport security on steroids.\nAnything that we're carrying with us.\nMore likely, they left. Okay.\nanything we're carrying with us\nhas to go there.\nAnd then there's a body scan\nthat continues on the other side.\nI got.\nOkay. Shoes off.\nSo I'm back on.\nGracias.\nSee the total.\nOnce cleared,\nwe tour the vast campus,\nstarting with the armory.\nHe says they have to constantly\nremind themselves\nthat they're dealing with\nessentially the worst of the worst.\nAnd for that reason,\nthey need to be ready for whatever risks\nthey might face.\nIt's been equated\nto seven football stadiums.\nThat's almost multiple prisons\nwithin the prison.\nYou can see off to the distance\nthere's three different rings\nas they describe the far end.\nYou have one\nthat's nine meters high of concrete.\nAnd then above that\nthree meters\nof electrified fencing,\nthat's 15,000V, 15,000V.\nMore than a thousand security personnel,\nguards.\nPolice and military\nare stationed on site.\nInmates are assigned\nto one of eight sectors.\nThe director tells me the inmates,\nonce they're inside one of the sectors,\nthey never leave.\nEverything is done within,\nincluding doctors,\nas well\nas legal visits or court hearings.\nEach sector holds\nmore than two dozen large cells.\nRoughly 80 inmates per cell,\nbut it can fluctuate.\nMost bare the markings of the gangs\nthat held this nation hostage\nfor decades,\ncommitting brutal acts of violence.\nYou got to kill people.\nYou got to rob.\nYou got to do what\nyou got to do to survive.\nYou have to do those things.\nYeah, you got to do that.\nAnd if you didn't do those things,\nyou wouldn't.\nYou want to be a gangbanger?\nWe meet 41 year old Marvin Vasquez,\nshackled and heavily guarded.\nWhat gang were you part of?\nMs13.\nAnd do you have any gang affiliations?\nYeah, I'm tattooed up.\nI just remember the names.\nWhat is this crazy criminal say?\nCrazy criminal?\nYeah.\nI made this click in 2011.\nYou made the click? Yeah.\nYou were a gang leader.\nYeah.\nWhat is it like to to live here?\nIt's probably not a hotel five star, but\nthey give you the three times the food.\nThey give you some programs you go to.\nYou got to do exercise\nfor some church or religion programs to.\nBut that's limited to just 30 minutes\na day.\nThe other 23.5 hours,\nthey're kept inside and locked up\nfor inmates who get violent\nwith other prisoners or guards.\nInstead of the protocols.\nWe're going to close the door.\nI just want to get a sense of.\nWow.\nSolitary confinement awaits.\nThe only light\nyou can see through this hole.\nAnd they can be in here for\n15 days, potentially.\nAll right,\nI'm ready to get out the.\nCritics point specifically\nto the prison's strict control\nand isolation of inmates,\ncalling it a violation of human rights.\nThe director brought up\nthat a lot of folks will raise concerns\nfrom a human rights perspective\nand an abuse of human rights,\nthat he's come hearing that\nbecause he sees it day to day.\nThe process\nthey go through to maintain,\nas he sees it, proper punishment\nwhile you're cut off from society here.\nWhispers of life on the outside\nmake their way in.\nI've heard about it\nthat it's a new El Salvador.\nIt looks different\nthat new El Salvador has emerged\nunder President Nayib Bukele,\nwho took office in 2019 and declared\na controversial state of emergency\nmore than two years ago.\nIt sparked an aggressive\ncrackdown on crime.\nWe see that firsthand as some\n2500 police and soldiers\ndeploy into one neighborhood.\nIt's going to go on through the night.\nFor however long it takes\nfor them to root out\nany suspected criminal elements.\nLate last week, as the U.S.\nState Department lowered its travel\nadvisory for El Salvador,\nciting a significant reduction in crime,\nit also warned that Bukele's\nemergency measures\nallow authorities to arrest\nanyone suspected\nof gang activity\nand suspends constitutional rights.\nJuan Carlos tells me\nhe was wrongfully held for five months\nat a lower security prison\nearlier this year.\nHe says the poor conditions\nled to an infection in his leg.\nHe said he was lumped in\nand assumed to be part of a gang.\nAnd he said, in part\nbecause of how he looked.\nHe had long\nhair, said he had a long beard\nand he says he has tattoos,\nbut he points out that for him\nthese are just artistic expressions.\nThey have nothing to do\nwith being part of a gang.\nthe administration has acknowledged\nthat innocent people\nhave been swept up in the crackdown,\nand they say more than 7000\nhave already been released.\nThey see it as collateral damage.\nAnd Juan Carlos,\nwhile frustrated with the tactics,\nbelieves under Bill Kelly\nhis country is safer.\nIs this headquarters for you guys?\nYes. Okay. Yes.\nFor Kelly,\nsecurity minister targets\ngangs with an academic like approach.\nI urge you, have a book.\nIs it true? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nAnd this is a book\nthat has the markings of gang members,\nthe marks.\nThe minister compiling his findings\nfrom his nearly 30 years\nin law enforcement\nto help interpret gang symbols.\nWow.\nThese three dots,\nit says, signify\nthree things to the gang members\nthat they have\nthree destinations,\nessentially jail, hospital or cemetery.\nFrom his office,\nhe monitors crime\nreports in real time\nand keeps tabs on his officers\nin the field.\nYou can say, you know,\nif there's a particular officer\nthat's in an area that's in question,\nwhy were you there so long?\nWhat are you doing?\nAnd you can hold them accountable,\nyou know.\nHe says the program they've built\nhas started to incorporate AI,\nwhich can tell them where you have to put\nyour police officer.\nAnd yet\nmost we meet seem\nunfazed by the added show of force,\nthe same difficulty.\nI asked him, I said,\nhow do you feel with all these soldiers?\nI mean, there's a couple of dozen just\nI mean, right outside his door.\nAnd he said, I feel safe.\nI sat next to George\nMoran on my flight in.\nHis family fled El Salvador civil war\nwhen he was three.\nJust coming to the airport.\nYou you feel the sense of, like, safety,\nyou know, because you feel it in the US.\nNo, you don't know.\nAnd you live in Indiana. Yes, sir.\nGeorge fully supports President Kelly,\nas do most arriving passengers.\nIt seems,\nand folks are actually stopping\nto get their pictures\ntaken between President and First lady.\nOh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nUnder a state of emergency,\nlaw enforcement have arrested\nmore than 81,000 people.\nEl Salvador now has one of\nthe world's highest incarceration rates.\nMost end up in facilities like these,\nwhere they can work\nto reduce their sentences for\nthe most hardened criminals, though,\nbrought to court,\nwhere inside, a life sentence awaits.\nWe did bad things.\nWe paid the rough way.\nDo time.\nAnd yet, for many on the outside,\nthe prison now a symbol of newfound\nfreedom,\nthe new El Salvador as they see it.",

    "transcript": "This is La Campanera.\nIt used to be one of the\nmost dangerous neighborhoods,\nin the most dangerous city,\nin one of the most dangerous\ncountries in the world.\nEl Salvador.\nEl Salvador has been known\nas the murder capital of the world.\nJust to get an idea, in 2015,\nthe murder rate in El Salvador\nwas higher than any country\non Earth and more than 20\ntimes higher than the US.\nBut right now, La Campanera\nfeels downright safe\nin large part due to\na big police presence.\nGang related murders in\nEl Salvador have plummeted\nto their lowest levels this century,\nand almost every person\nattributes it to this man.\nEl Salvador's Nayib Bukele.\nSince coming to power, his\ntactics have led to the arrest\nof a higher percentage\nof its population than\nany country in the world.\n75,000 people and counting.\nMost citizens in El Salvador love Bukele\nwith his approval rating\nreaching as high as 92%,\nand the envy of almost every\nother Latin American leader\nwho are now starting to\nemulate his policies.\nBut for some, that miracle comes\nwith a steep cost...\ncivil liberties.\nThe future of El Salvador,\nand Latin America, is at a tipping point.\nDoes freedom have to be the\nprice to pay for safety?\nIn 2019, 37-year-old Nayib Bukele won\nEl Salvador's presidential election.\nEnding a long\nstretch when only two parties\nwere able to win power.\nPresident Bukele didn't\nrepresent the failures\nand corruption of\nprevious administrations.\nThree of his predecessors\nfrom El Salvador's,\ntwo main political parties,\nhad either been arrested or indicted.\nThen one weekend changed everything\nbetween March 24th and 27th, 2022\n87 people were\nmurdered in El Salvador,\nallegedly by gangs.\n'Plan Bukele' was a\n30-day state of emergency,\nbut since then,\nit's been extended 22 times and counting.\nIt suspended a wide range\nof constitutional rights.\nFrom freedom of association and assembly,\nto privacy and communications\nto being informed\nof the reason for arrests.\nThe new prison has a\ncapacity of 40,000 inmates.\nEach cell holds 100 prisoners.\nAll of it being showed off\non Bukele's official X account,\nformerly Twitter.\nAnd other countries are taking notes.\nEcuador's copying not only\nBukele's approach on X,\nbut emulating his prisons as well.\nAnd when it comes to the\nlong-term rehabilitation plan\nfor these prisoners, the\nBukele Administration\ndoes not mince words.\nOthers in El Salvador are not only critics\nof Bukele's harsh tactics, but victims\nMejia's daughter was arrested by the state\nfor allegedly belonging to a gang.\nHe's been fighting to get her out since,\nbut it's taken him months\nto even find her in the prison system.\nMejia has not seen\nor spoken to his daughter\nsince the arrest.\nMejia's story isn't unique in El Salvador,\nand that's how nonprofits\nlike Movír were born.\nHuman rights groups like Movír\nand Cristosal have reported 215 deaths\nand thousands of abuses\nrelated to the crackdown.\nCristosal released a report in 2022\nin which it denounced\nthat inmates in El Salvador had\ndied from torture, beatings,\nstrangulation, or lack\nof medical attention\nduring the state of exception.\nMany NGOs claim that El\nSalvadorans live in just\nas much fear today as they did\nbefore the state of emergency.\nEven though reelection is\nprohibited under the Salvadoran\nconstitution, the Supreme\nCourt cleared the way\nfor his reelection in 2024,\nBukele has also taken a leave\nof absence from the\npresidency to campaign.\nWhat's at stake in Bukele's\nsecond term is whether safety\nis sustainable in El Salvador.\nAnd whether it can one day exist without\nthe state of exception\nFor others, the economy\nis secondary on their mind\nas they fear the country falling further\nand further into the hands\nof an increasingly authoritarian leader.\nCan Bukele's popularity\nlast if he holds onto power\nfor much longer?",

this\nI look if you can get a ceasefire right\nnow I tell you you take it so the\nbullets stop Flying and you meant stop\ngetting killed course of course we want\nto stop the war but saying you don't\nwant to see said to you I want to see\nguar because you'll get a ceasefire\nfaster than I great ask how people about\nceas fire what they think that wasn't\nmatter for you that wasn't with me that\nwas with a guy named Biden who was not a\nsmart person that was that was with\nObama it was your president excuse me\nthat was with Obama who gave you sheets\nand I gave you javelins yes I gave you\nthe javelins to take out all those tanks\nObama gave you sheets in fact the\nstatement is Obama gave sheets and Trump\ngave\njavelins you got to be more thankful\nbecause let me tell you you don't have\nthe cards with us you have the cards\ncards but without us you don't have any\ncards one more question to Mr Vice\nPresident I'm sorry here be a tough deal\nto make um because the attitudes have to\nchange what if Russia breaks this fire\nwhat if Russia breaks this talks what do\nyou do then understand that it's a\nconversation right what are you saying\nshe's asking what if Russia breaks the\nceasefire what if they what if anything\nwhat if a bomb drops on your head right\nnow they okay what have they broke it I\ndon't know they broke it with Biden\nbecause Biden they didn't respect him\nthey didn't respect Obama they respect\nme let me tell you Putin went through a\nhell of a lot with me he went through a\nphony Witch Hunt where they used him and\nRussia Russia Russia Russia you ever\nhear of that deal that was a phony that\nwas a phony Hunter Biden Joe Biden scam\nHillary Clinton Shifty Adam Schiff it\nwas a Democrat scam and he had to go\nthrough that and he did go through it we\ndidn't end up in a war and he went\nthrough it he was accused of all that\nstuff he had nothing to do with it it\ncame out of Hunter Biden's bathroom it\ncame out of Hunter Biden's bedroom it\nwas disgusting and then they said oh oh\nthe laptop from hell was made by Russia\nthe 51 agents the whole thing was a scam\nand he had to put up with that he was\nbeing accused of all that stuff all I\ncan say is this he might have broken\ndeals with Obama and Bush and he might\nhave broken them with Biden he did maybe\nmaybe he didn't I don't know what\nhappened but he didn't break him with me\nhe wants to make a deal I don't know if\nyou can make a deal the problem is I've\nempowered you to be a tough guy and I\ndon't think you'd be a tough guy without\nthe United States and your people are\nvery brave but you're either going to\nmake a deal or we're out and if we're\nout you'll fight it out I don't think\nit's going to be pretty but you'll fight\nit out but you don't have the cards but\nonce we sign that deal you're in a much\nbetter position but you're not acting at\nall thankful and that's not a nice thing\nI'll be honest that's not a nice thing\nall right uh I think we've seen enough\nwhat do you think huh this is this is\ngoing to be great television I will say\nthat all right we'll see what we can do\nabout putting it\nguys come\non we'll see I don't know all right come\n[Music]",

    "transcript": "hi there in today's video we'll be\ncreating a portfolio website like this\nin under 15 minutes to showcase our data\nscience portfolio and we'll also be\ndeploying our website for free using a\ncustom domain if you own one many of you\nhave probably done really amazing\nprojects you might have put some cool\nprojects up on your github written some\narticles here and there or published\nyour dashboards on tableau public and so\non but one little problem with that is\nthat those projects are scattered on\ndifferent platforms on the internet\nwhich makes it a bit inconvenient for\nyou to showcase them to other people one\nperfect solution for this and it's\nexactly what we'll be tackling today is\nto create a portfolio website where you\ncan tie everything together in one\ncentral place showing who you are and\nmaybe telling about your most weird\nhobbies it helps people know you better\nand therefore it's a very good way to\nbuild credentials and even a personal\nbrand so today we'll be using stackbit\nto build our portfolio website no coding\nis required you might be thinking what\nyou're a nerd and you don't know how to\ngo to website well i used to develop my\nown website for example this watercolor\nslash tech blog very weird combination\nusing the static side generator gatsby\njs as much as i love coding and\ndesigning websites i quickly realized\nhow time consuming it is to build and\ncustomize things to my liking and i also\ngenerally find it uninspiring to write\nblog posts in markdown so that's why i\nturn to stack bit so what the heck is\nspec bit it's basically a website\nbuilder but a quite different kind of\nwebsite builder compared to squarespace\nor wix it provides web developers with a\nvisual tool to quickly build and edit a\njam stack website and this visual tool\nalso helps developers and non-developers\nwork together easily even though this\ntool is made more for developers and you\ncan certainly choose do all the coding\nif you like the good thing is there are\nalso a few really nice pre-designed\nthemes that we can use and this is what\nwe'll be doing today let's get started\nall right so let's head over to\nstackmate website then we're gonna go to\nget started so as you can see here this\nis a comment that you can use to start a\nlocal development environment if you\nwant to go to your website yourself\nhowever for this simple portfolio\nwebsite that we'll be creating today\nwe'll just start with a pre-designed\ntheme so here we have a couple of\ndifferent themes here i'll go ahead and\nchoose this theme so if you haven't had\nan account yet at some point you have to\nsign up but i already have an account so\ni'll just go ahead and start my project\nso here we can name our project let's\nsay this is my website then we click on\ncreate sites it will take a couple of\nseconds when you first load the website\nthis is our website so this is all the\ncode for the website and this is based\non next.js and if you want to you can\neven transfer all the gold to your\ngithub repo so this is pretty nice you\ncan deploy your website anywhere you\nwant but today we are not going to\ntinker with any of the code we will just\nvisually edit our website so this is the\nwebsite that we have let's start editing\nour website so here i have the title\ni'll just change it to my name and here\nwe have the navigation bar and here we\nhave adventures\nlet's see what it is\nthe venture is basically the blog posts\nso i will go ahead and change this to\nproject for example so this section will\nbe where i write my about my project\nhere we have the\ncontact say this is contact me i feel\nlike i don't particularly like this hero\nsection so much so i'll go ahead and try\nto replace it with something else here\nyou can see the add section button here\nclick on it and then you'll see that\nthere are a bunch of different\ncomponents or the sections that you can\nchoose from if we go to the hero so this\nis the current hero section that we have\ni feel like this one is a bit better so\ni'll choose it\nand then i can delete this section\nand now we can go ahead and adjust this\nhero section here we can say welcome to\nmy portfolio website then here we can\nsay yeah a few words about ourselves ah\nwhat should i say data node learning\ncreativity the url of this one is block\nso i want to direct this button to the\nblog page on our website i will edit\nthis as well this will see projects we\ncan also change our pictures let me\nupload okay i have a portrait photo\nlooks good if you have a landscape photo\ninstead you can just put in the photo\neditor in your computer and then you can\ncrop your picture to this kind of size\nso this looks already pretty good right\nlet's preview it we can even publish it\nyou can see that this is a default\ndomain of our website so later in this\nvideo we'll be connecting our website to\na custom domain that we own and here\nthis is the publish button we can click\non it and then the website will be\ndeployed to this default domain now\nwhile waiting for our website to be\npublished we can continue editing our\nwebsite in this hero section i also want\nto add a few links to for example my\nlinkedin profile and my github profile\nas well so let's click on this little\nplus button here and you can choose to\nadd here either another button or a link\nso i'll choose a link so here we have\nthe default learn more and so i can\ndirect this link to an url we can just\ncopy this url paste it here we can add\nan icon here so here we have the\nlinkedin icon now in a very similar\nfashion we will go ahead and create\nanother link to our github profile so\nhere we will have our url which is our\ngithub profile i'll paste it here and in\nthe styling we will add an icon which is\nour github which is here and show this\nicon\nand here we can remove this label learn\nmore this looks very nice and now we can\ngo ahead and edit other sections of our\nwebsite as well\nso here's the quote\nsection so maybe we can choose this\ncolor to make it pop a little bit more\nso these colors\nwe can edit in our styling\nsection here the global styling if you\ngo to the color palette you can see that\nthis is the color palette that is used\nat the moment but we can certainly\nchoose a different color for our website\na very nice website for this is the cool\ncolor yeah coolers dot co it has all\nkinds of different colors so we can\nstart the generator and here are the\ndifferent kind of color combination that\nwe can choose from this is pretty handy\nif you want to select a different kind\nof color palette now we want to have a\ndifferent quote this one is pretty nice\nwe cannot solve our problems with the\nsame thinking we used when we created\nthem i'll just do this one and copy to\nour quote section here we can say this\nis from\nalbert einstein and here we can\nbasically remove this the next section\nis basically the posts section so\nbasically the blog section here we have\ntwo blog posts here we will go ahead and\nedit them in a bit here we can say\nsomething like a recent project\nand here we can say\nthis is a co project instead\nhere are the blog posts that are default\nin this theme but we'll go ahead and\ndelete them and create our own blog post\nbecause they have at the moment like\ndifferent slots and we don't want to use\nthese locks so let's duplicate this one\nthe first one is probably python\ndashboard and this is a default blog\npost on our website we can change the\npicture here to a picture of our project\nand here we can say interactive of co2\nemissions\nusing panel hp plot we can select\ndifferent dates so we can choose maybe\ntoday and then we can edit the content\nof our blog post here we have different\nkind of header here we can say\nmotivation and we can even embed a\npicture then we could even create a\nquote a lot of data visualization and uh\nif you select the markdown here if you\ntoggle on this you can see that this is\nthe markdown format of our blog post as\ni mentioned earlier i'm not very big fan\nof writing blog posts in this kind of\nfashion let's go back to the home here\nwe can remove this blog post\nand we can add another post here um we\nsay existing we'll select this post that\nwe just created yeah the picture is now\nstill default picture we will select our\nown picture about the project so yeah\nthis is our blog post this one also\nwe'll go ahead and remove it and we can\nadd another blog post here let's\nduplicate this one suicidal landscape\nwe will change this picture to\nthis one\nand here we can say the name of the\nproject is visualizing\nthe suicidal cases\nin the netherlands in 2018 and yes so we\ncan add post here existing um you can\nadd this one\nchange the picture okay this is very\nnice the keep reading link label now at\nthe moment is a joint adventure so we\ncan say here probably read more and here\num in the styling\nwe can even change to different kinds of\narrangements so at the moment it is two\ncolumns grid but we can also choose to\nhave a list instead so let's see what it\nlooks like so this is the list format\nbut i'll just keep the two columns great\ni think it looks much better\nand i can probably also promote my\nyoutube channel i also make videos on\nyoutube\nwe can also change this picture to\nanother picture a very nice website for\nroyalty-free picture is unsplash so you\ncan search for anything for example\nyoutube\norientation landscape let's say i want\nto have this photo then i can go ahead\nand select this photo\nso\nadd background image\noops i chose a different image for my\nlaptop i just leave it and in the about\nsection we can also go ahead and adjust\nthis about section we can add a picture\nof ourselves for example\nand as i mentioned earlier we can also\ncreate a whole new page for our website\nso to do that we will click on the plus\nbutton here we will create for example\nadd a new empty page and we can select\nthe slack for this page the gallery for\nexample\nthen this is the empty page that we have\nand we can add different sections here\nfor example media gallery\nto create a link to this page we can add\nsomething in the navigation pane for\nexample we can create a link we will\nhave the url here we can say this will\ndirect to the gallery page we can have\nalso the label here is gallery rather\nyeah so now we have this page and if we\nclick on it then this will be our new\npage and to publish the website you can\nsee here this is all the changes that we\nhave made and we can go ahead and click\non the publish button\nso on namecheap or godaddy you can buy a\ndomain very cheaply for example i bought\nthis domain name\nconscientiousgeek.com for like nine\ndollars so domain names are usually very\ncheap if you don't have the same name as\nelon musk for example now we'll go ahead\nand connect our website to this domain\nname so if you click on the clock icon\nover here and go to the domain tab you\nsee the steps we need to take to connect\nour website to our own domain name so we\nbasically follow the instructions on\nthis page we need to add two records to\nour dns settings the first one is a\ncname record and the second one is an a\nrecord so for the cname record we just\ngo ahead and copy paste our current\nproject domain name here\nand for the a record we'll enter a value\nfield specified in the instructions\nwhich is 75 to 65. i realized later that\ni should replace stack bit with netlify\non the domain name here because the\nwebsite is actually hosted on netlify so\ndon't forget to change it for your own\ncase as well now you can go ahead and\nsave those records\nthe next step is to simply to enter a\ncustom domain in this box and click on\nsave now it usually takes an hour or two\nfor those dns changes to propagate\nthrough the internet's global domain\nname service system so please be patient\nand check the status again after a few\nhours just a side note if you get stuck\nat this step for very long time then you\nshould try to remove and fill in your\ndomain name again in this box this has\nhelped me before so this is our final\nwebsite which looks pretty decent and is\nalso connected to our custom domain\nwhich is really really nice the next\nstep is to promote your website and let\npeople know about your project whenever\nyou write about a new project on your\nwebsite make a tweet about it and add a\nlink to your website you can also write\nposts on linkedin as well to share with\nyour professional network which i\nusually feel too embarrassed to do\nanother way to promote your blog which i\nlike is import your blog post into\nmedium it's very easy to do all you need\nto do is to enter the url of your blog\npost and click on import then you can\nfurther customize your post on medium\nand you may notice that at the end of\nthe post there's an automatic line that\nsays this post is originally published\non your website which is really great\nbecause people who read your article can\nalso go to your website if they want to\nso in this video i showed you one of the\nmost simple and low budget ways to\ncreate a website but there are many\nother options as well you can choose\nfrom the most basic way is to build a\nsimple html css file on html5 up website\nfor example you can find a bunch of nice\ntemplates for this but this option is\nusually only suitable for websites that\nhave only a few pages and not suitable\nfor blogging because every time you make\na new page you'll have to copy paste the\nwhole html together with the header\nphoto and other components on the page\nwhich is very cumbersome so the solution\nthat people often turn to is to use\nstatic side generators like hugo gatsby\nand j gold they are free and open source\ntools to build website and i love them\nbut they often require quite some\nknowledge of web development and it can\ntake a lot of coding to make a website\ndecent looking even if you just want to\ncustomize a pre-designed theme on the\nother end of spectrum we have no code\nwebsite builders that offer visual\nediting interface like wix and\nsquarespace they are very convenient but\nthey are not free you typically pay 10\nto 20 bucks a month for using the theme\nand for the hosting service which is\nunnecessary in my opinion because you\ncan technically host your portfolio\nwebsite for zero dollar using github\npage or netlife so it's totally your\ncore what best fits your experience and\nbudget having built this amazing\nportfolio website that you can use for\ndata science blogging now you can focus\non doing projects if you are looking for\nproject ideas you can check out my\nprevious video over here about how i\nfind project ideas and also check out\nthe portfolio project playlist on my\nchannel for some end-to-end project\ntutorials in r and python again if you\ngot any value from this video don't\nforget to hit the like button and\nsubscribe if you haven't already for\nmore data science related content and\nwith that i'll see you in the next video\nbye",

    "transcript": "everyone I'm sure and in this video I'm\ngoing to walk through a super easy way\nto make a portfolio website without any\ncoding using GitHub pages so it's about\nthat time of year people are graduating\ngraduating college maybe you're\ngraduating grad school and now it's time\nto enter the workforce and if you're\nlike a lot of people you've probably\nheard of data science and how data\nscientists are doing all these cool\nthings you know they're building chat\ngpts they're building models they're\nusing machine learning and AI to solve\nbusiness problems and create impacts and\nthis sounds like a really fun and\nexciting field to be a part of as\nsomeone that works in data science a big\nproblem for a lot of data scientists is\nnot so much knowing your stuff like the\ntechnical side of things but it's the\nability to show your stuff and sell\nyourself and this is just something that\nyou never really do When developing the\nskill set to become a data scientist but\nif you're trying to get a job whether\nthat's full-time at a company or you\nwant to go into freelancing or\nConsulting being able to sell yourself\nis a critical part of the process so one\nthing that I found super helpful in\ngetting data science work is having a\nwebsite portfolio that employers can go\nto to see my experience my projects and\njust get to know me but the problem is\nI'm a data scientist I can build you a\nmachine learning model but don't ask me\nto build you a website because it's not\ngoing to be great so I'm totally\nincompetent with HTML CSS any kind of\nlike web dev type of stuff and if you're\na data scientist it's likely that you're\nin a similar boat but lucky for us our\nfriend GitHub has this built-in\nfunctionality for generating and hosting\nwebsites completely for free without\nrequiring any kind of web development\nexperience whatsoever so GitHub Pages\nmakes this spinning up a website super\nsimple and I use this functionality a\nlot in grad school in spinning up\nwebsites for my own portfolio and for\nprojects that I was working on quickly\nrunning through here what the steps are\nyou have these two options you can build\na website from scratch and just host it\non GitHub or you can go a much easier\nroute where GitHub will generate you a\nwebsite automatically from your readme\nfile using a package called Jekyll And\nso here all you gotta do is fill out\nyour readme file with what you want in\nyour portfolio and then Jekyll will take\nthat text and generate a website based\non the theme that you choose not too\nlong ago like one two years ago this was\nlike really really stupid simple just\nlooking at this website it's a\npages.github.com just a few steps so you\ngo to the repository settings and then\nit used to have this Theme Chooser built\nin so you just say like which branch you\nhave your readme file in and then you\njust like choose a theme and then you\nhave this user interface this GUI where\nyou could just click which theme you\nwanted and it would just automatically\ngenerate the website so when I first\nwanted to make this video I'm like okay\nyeah it's gonna be super simple show\npeople how they can make a website\ncompletely for free free without any web\ndevelopment experience whatsoever but\nwhen I came to spin up my website this\nbutton was not there anymore this kind\nof let me down a rabbit hole trying to\nfigure out what happened couldn't find\nanything anywhere no one's made a\nYouTube video about this no one's\nwritten a Blog about this github's\ndocumentation was not very helpful to me\nhowever after messing around with it for\na couple hours I finally figured it out\nand now I'm gonna walk through step by\nstep how you can build your website\nusing GitHub pages and this built-in\nfunctionality so this is what the final\nproduct looks like so it's a really\nclean design cool looking website you\nhave your picture here you think about\nyour name like whatever job you're\nlooking for I didn't do any kind of\ncoding whatsoever I just typed up a\nmarkdown file and this was automatically\ngenerated so I was able to throw this\ntogether in less than 30 minutes because\na lot of the stuff it's just like copy\npasting from your LinkedIn or your\nresume or something similar and so this\nis the final product now I'll walk\nthrough the steps to build this so first\nstep go to your GitHub Pro profile if\nyou don't have a GitHub profile go ahead\nand make one it should be\nstraightforward and a good idea if\nyou're trying to get a job in data\nscience here at our GitHub profile we're\ngoing to go ahead and click repositories\nand you can see this is the example\nportfolio I made this past week but\nwe're not going to go there we're going\nto start over from scratch and click new\nand then we should get a screen like\nthis so create a new repository\nrepository name so we have two options\nhere option one is if you want this\nportfolio website name to just be your\nGitHub\nusername.github.io you just type that in\nright here so Shaheen T is my username\nGitHub dot IO this will appear in the\nsearch bar and this will be your website\nname I already created a website\nportfolio using this website name so\nit's not going to work for me but if you\nhaven't done this already then it should\nwork for you the second option is you\ncan give it any repository name you like\nso it could just be portfolio well it\ncould be data science it could be data\nscientist you know whatever you want and\nwhat's going to happen in the search bar\nfor example if you make your repository\nname portfolio what's going to appear in\nthe search bar is going to be your\nGitHub\nusername.github dot IO slash whatever\nyou make this repository name so if I\nmake a portfolio it'll be Shaheen T\ngithub.io portfolio Okay so we'll go\nahead and name it portfolio we don't\nneed a description here and it's\nprobably best that we don't have one but\nwe're going to initialize our repository\nwith a readme file so we'll click that\nthis is gonna make it really quick and\neasy to spin up our website I'm not\ngoing to have a git ignore we're not\ngoing to add a license that's not\nnecessary so just to recap we make our\nrepository name either our GitHub\nusername.github.io or whatever other\nname that we like so just go in\nportfolio here don't need a description\nand just be sure to click read me and\nthen we're gonna create repository and\nthere we go so now we have the super\nBare Bones repository so we already have\na readme file here but we're going to\nneed to add one more file called a\nconfig file so to do that we can just go\nto add file create new file and we'll\ncall it\nconfig.yml and so now that GitHub got\nrid of this choose theme button in the\ninterface so let me go back now that\nthey got rid of this choose theme button\nhere and you can't have this super easy\nuser interface for picking your theme\nyou have to do it using this config.yaml\nfile and so this is actually super\nsimple and it's not much more difficult\nthan this interface so I'm going to kind\nof jump ahead and this is the config\nfile for the example that I've already\nput together we can just go ahead and\nlike copy paste this\nso title would be at the top left corner\nof the portfolio website so you can just\nput your name here logo we can actually\ncomment this out for now because this is\ngoing to be the relative path of the\nimage you want on that left hand side so\nlet me just go back so this is where the\ntitle appears this logo relative path\nis where this image is located in your\nGitHub repo but since we're starting\nfresh I'm going to comment that out if\nyou want to add text below here so if we\nadded a description to our repo it would\nappear here or we can overwrite that by\nmanually putting a description here so\nshow downloads true it's just giving you\nthese options to download the zip the\ntar or go to the GitHub so I put true\nfor my example portfolio if people want\nto steal the code but for yours I mean\nthis is optional if you want people to\nbe able to download your code you can\nmake it false or just comment it out and\nthen finally the key thing is this theme\nso instead of being able to click on the\ntheme we have to manually kind of type\nit out using this syntax here so I went\nwith this Jekyll theme minimal so that's\nwhat we're seeing here it's super Sleek\nsuper nice I think it makes a lot of\nsense for a portfolio but if you don't\nlike that for every reason there are a\nbunch of other supported themes for\nexample let's click on architect and we\ncan see what that looks like so that\nlooks like this a little different\ndifferent design but again this will be\ngenerated automatically based on your\nreadme file in the GitHub repository so\nI'll share this link it's\npages.github.com themes and I'll share\nit below if you want to explore the\nother theme options okay so we have our\ntitle we're going to have show downloads\nwe're going to just comment this out we\ndon't really need that and then we're\njust left here so really right now all\nyou need is the title and the theme that\nyou want to choose you go ahead and hit\ncommit changes and so now you have two\nfiles in your repository you have your\nreadme file and your config file and now\nyou can just start adding stuff in here\nso like data scientist\neducation work experience\nuh data scientists full of points here\nwe go big impact project one big impact\nproject\ntwo let's see what else is good to have\nhere education your work experience what\nelse do I have projects yes that's\nimportant so projects see uh and then so\non and so forth so you can start just\nbuilding some stuff out I'm just doing\nthis so when we spin up the website\nsomething appears so just through\nsomething really simple together here\nand so still we just have a readme file\nin this simple config.yaml file and then\nthe last step is to go to settings here\nwe're in settings then we're going to\nscroll down to pages and then we have\nthis section here build and deployment\nso here we're going to leave the source\nas is we're going to deploy from a\nbranch and then under Branch we're just\ngoing to hit Main and then we're going\nto keep it as root because we want\nGitHub pages to look at the readme file\nand the config file in our root\ndirectory and we're going to hit save so\nnow notice that we didn't have that\nsuper simple\nGUI to select our theme and then if you\nhit add a jackal theme you get some\ninstructions here but I got tripped up\non theme theme name because this isn't\nthe right syntax here so this uh typo\nhere\nit's uh made this like really\nstraightforward task like a two-hour\ntask for me so you can put just Minima\nor minimal here you have to put Jekyll\nDash theme Dash Minima so if you were in\na similar boat and you were struggling\nfor hours like me it's just a simple\nsyntax issue and that's why the\nwebsite's not working anyway going back\nso if we go here to actions we see it's\nalready been built but if we came back\nearlier we would have seen this is like\nprocessing and something's happening but\nwe built Pages was built and deployed so\nif we click over here to deployment we\ncan hit this view deployment option here\nand it'll take us to our website so oh\nlook at that then you can look in your\nsearch bar what the website name is so\nfor me it's\nshaheent.github.io portfolio and then if\nwe look over here we see our readme file\nbuilt out we have data scientists which\nwas in the title so I'll go back so we\ncan compare so we have our readme file\nhere so data scientist\neducation\nwork experience\nprojects EEG band discovery that looks a\nlittle different but looks better here\non the website and then we just build it\nout and so we can kind of do it on the\ncooking shows where I don't walk through\nthe process here and just kind of jump\nto the final product and so going to\nthis example portfolio repo here are a\nfew simple things to do one I'll\ndefinitely add a assets slash image path\nand then dump all the images you want to\nuse in your portfolio here going back\nnext big thing is so we'll go ahead and\nedit this readme and so configuring a\nreadme file is a lot easier than\nbuilding a website with HTML you can\njust copy paste this or clone the repo\nand use this as a starting point you can\ncustomize the structure you can start\ncompletely from scratch whatever makes\nsense for you just a couple things you\nknow you can add links here so this is\nthe standard GitHub syntax you just say\nwhat you want the text to appear as and\nthen this is what the link is that\npeople click on if you want to add\nimages you put the title of whatever\nimage and then you put the relative path\nto the image so again it's in this\nassets image subdirectory and then\nthat's the file name and then so on and\nso forth so really go to town on this\nyou know you can spend probably hours\njust tweaking and fine-tuning it but\nthis is hopefully a nice jump start and\nit'll get you something pretty close to\na final product okay so I rambled on a\nbit at the end there but hopefully this\nis helpful you know it's hard to get\nthat first job and bring to the data\nscience field so I hope this kind of\naccelerates that process for you and if\nyou enjoyed this video please consider\nliking subscribing and sharing the video\nwith others if you have any questions\nabout like building a portfolio or like\ngetting a job data science you know feel\nfree to drop those in the comment\nsection below I do read all the

positions which happens with the\nUniversity team in that case you should\nstart applying as soon as possible which\nis like July end or August 1 week but\nnow everyone is applying with a referral\nand it's really important to do\nsomething which everyone else is not\ndoing okay so you came and you applied\nand you got it yeah nine out of 10 time\npeople respond to your cold email I'm\ncurious what exactly do you send them\nalso like how do you find those people\nthank you akriti for doing this really\nmeans a lot first of all thank you for\nbeing kind and sharing the good news\nwith me that you got the job in Google\nwhich is awesome I am excited for you\nhopefully you will be soon in sunal so I\ncan come and meet you in person of\ncourse and and I know we're going to do\na separate video on the UC San dieago\nwhich is also going to be exciting let's\ndo a quick intro like where are you from\nwhere are you right now what do you do\nand like what have you been doing and I\ncompleted my bachelor's from bit mesra a\ncollege in chhand in India and currently\nI'm pursuing my masters in computer\nscience at the University of California\nSan Diego uh with a specialization in\nsystems it's a very generic computer\nscience degree but we get to choose a\ndepth area so my depth area is systems\nand I'm headed towards a job at Google\nin the Bay Area and it's a software\nengineer 3 position so yeah that's\nmostly it that is awesome so software I\nmean I think people might not know what\nsoftware engineer 3 is like a senior\nsoftware engineer and not the uh the one\nwhich people typically get is software\nengineer one or two uh so so that is\nawesome I'm I'm so excited did you have\nany like work experience two years of\nwork experience at Walmart in India and\nI was working as a backend software\nengineer so uh here the criteria is you\nshould be two years or more so for me it\nwas just two years and one month so that\nis why I was eligible for software\nengineer 3 is it harder interview\nprocess for software engineer 3 versus\nsoftware you you I don't know if you\nknow that yeah I mean uh they Grill you\nmore because they try to see how clear\nyour Basics are in some some companies\nthey ask you for system design but\nGoogle does not ask you software uh\nsystem design for L4 position which is\nthe software engineer three position\nokay now you are doing you did your\nMasters in use computer science but then\nyou chose a specialization again I know\nwe're going to cover this in a separate\nvideo uh and you were doing your Masters\nat some point you're like all right I\nneed to have an internship I need to\nhave a full-time job When what when did\nyou start start looking for full-time\njob and then what was your the first\nstep like okay this is when I'm going to\nlike this is what the first thing I'm\ngoing to do okay so this actually varies\nlike for example if I am I had two years\nof experience and I was targeting the\nhigher positions like not the entry\nlevel but one level higher so for that\nyou can you should ideally start 2 to 3\nmonths before your graduation date so\nlike I am graduating in December 2023 so\nI started looking September because\nbefore that they won't consider you so\nuh companies think of it this way like\neven if you're are hiring an industry\nprofessional they'll give a notice\nperiod which will be like 30 days or 60\ndays and then the interview process can\ntake about 2 weeks to four weeks so that\nway two months to two and a half months\nis an ideal period for them to hire you\nif you're graduating within that\ninterval but if you're looking for\nstarting positions which is your new\ngrad positions which happens with the\nUniversity team in that case you should\nstart applying as soon as possible which\nis like July end or August first week\nmaximum yes yeah 100% yeah I agree uh\nbecause I think Google Facebook all\nthese big companies they hired like\nAugust September is like their peak time\nuh and even like if they are hiring for\nsummer internship that is also again the\nsame window like August to November for\nthe next year's summer internship did\nyou have any internship yeah I interned\nat Salesforce as a software engineering\nintern now I'm intrigued by Salesforce\nbecause I didn't know that that you had\nthat so let's talk through how did you\nget the internship first and then we'll\ntalk about like full-time okay um when\ndid you start for internship because I\nknow Salesforce also does the same\nhiring cycle which is August to November\nbut when when did you apply and when did\nyou get the interview call so August end\nor September 1 week I was actively\nlooking and that is when I actually\napplied and I applied with a referal and\nI would like to say this that when I was\napplying which was in\n2021 or 2022 because I was 2022 intake\nso that time it was different because\nthat time not a lot of people were\napplying with referrals so basically\nwhoever was applying with a referal was\nat a higher position but now everyone is\napplying with a referal and it's really\nimportant to do something which everyone\nelse is not doing so that your resume\nstands out or people actually notice you\nso um I applied with the referral and\nthen I cleared the interviews and then I\ngot in but for someone who is applying\nnow I would recommend cold emailing and\nmaking somehow your profile visible to\nthe recruiter because even if you apply\nwith referrals there are thousands of\nmore candidates who may even be more\nqualified than you if you're a fresher\nand in that case your profile does not\nstand out and it's very difficult so uh\neither try out um different websites\nlike Venture Loop agent is one which\nreally helped me because many of their\npostings are not available on LinkedIn\nwhere everyone applies through to the\ncommon jobs on LinkedIn so if the number\nof applicants are less than the chances\nincreased basically so trying to mail\nstartups or basically applying in places\nwhere not a lot of people would be\napplying would increase your chances you\ncan yourself be strategic because today\napplying there might help but somehow\nother people might also get to know that\noh this is the website where I can apply\nto Unique jobs and they might also start\napplying so you need to keep thinking\nthat how can you increase your chances\nby applying in places where not a lot of\ncompetition is there because even if you\nhave a very great profile with such huge\nnumber of applicants and so many\nexperienced people applying for the same\nrole as you it's really difficult to get\nyour profile visible um for especially\nfor people who are coming in fall uh so\nlet's say they come in August and they\nare like okay I have plenty of time they\ndon't really have a plenty of time\nbecause if they want summer internship\nthey need to apply like in August or\nSeptember because that's when the\nopening happens obviously you can't look\nsounds like you you are a spring student\nno no no I was a fall student I came in\nSeptember so UCSD the fall quarter\nstarts in September okay so you came and\nyou applied and you got it\nyeah that's awesome yeah that is so cool\nso obviously you had your resume and\nprofile kind of worked on before coming\nto United States is that correct yeah\nyeah okay nice okay um you said like you\none you said you used referal for\nSalesforce and Salesforce it was It\nsoftware engineer role as well\nyeah got it so how did you w get the\nreferral like did you know someone or\ndid you find someone and then got the\nreferral like was it cold cold or was it\nlukewarm it was cold cold but then again\ncompanies have this two kind of referals\nthat one is an active referral where if\nthe person knows you personally they can\nwrite a personalized paragraph about you\nwhich is more valuable and second is a\npassive referal where they just put in\nyour resume and then no one really\nbothers much but but I would recommend\nlike this person from whom I took a\nreferral she did not know me and then\nshe was willing to write that\npersonalized paragraph which I sent to\nher itself like most of the people do\nthat and because it's a tough market and\neveryone kind of knows how important it\nis I've seen people more willing to\nhelp Okay so let's I mean I know we're\ngoing to probably all over the place now\nso how did you find this person and then\nuh like how did you what was your\nbecause it sounds like you were telling\nme this off camera that um you nine out\nof 10 time people respond to your Cil\nI'm curious what exactly do you send\nthem and uh also like H how do you find\nthose people okay so like when I was\napplying for internships I had one thing\nin mind that that person should have\ndone a master's from a US University and\nshould be a one year or two years back\npass out because they will understand\nyour situation better and so they know\nwhat the importance of a referral is and\nwhat the importance of getting an\ninternship program internship in a one\nyear to twoyear program is it's really\nimportant so they generally respond back\nand maybe I get lucky when I get those\nresponses but if you personalize your\ncontent to even if you're writing to the\nrecruiter or if you're asking for a\nreferral if you personalize your content\nsaying that this is what we have in\ncommon or saying that I am really these\nare my top skill sets and I feel I'm a\ngreat match for this position and I\nreally need a referral or something like\nthat then the chances of getting a\nresponse is higher compared to oh I\ninterested in this company can you give\nme a referral got it so personalizing\ncustomizing it and you doing the work\nversus making the referal person do the\nwork for you sounds like so again break\nthis down in simple terms you you I'm\nassuming you found the person on\nLinkedIn yes you go on LinkedIn you hit\nsearch uh you filter it on people like\nokay I want to see Salesforce people so\ndid you like filter it on Salesforce\nnecessarily yes okay so that sounds like\nyou had a list of Target companies and\nthen you started like find the people\nfrom that Target companies then you're\nlike okay this person looks like she has\n2 three years of experience you'll\nunderstand my situation now I'm going to\nreach out to that but it wasn't like hey\nis there anything available in your\ncompany I'm I would be great for you\nalso did the research of like here's the\nposition here's why I'm good fit for it\nand would you be able to connect with me\nand then you I think that's kind of the\npath you took and that got you the most\nresult yeah correct and like yeah I\nwould also recommend that when you get\nsome updates right like suppose you get\nan interview call back then keep\nupdating the person because it really\nfeels good and then seeing you succeed\nthey feel happy and then they are\nwilling to help you more yeah you came\nto United States you started applying\nyou reached out to someone at Salesforce\num you know they referred you and then\nyou got the internship great I'm\nassuming it was a great experience I was\nin Salesforce office recently so I I did\nthe whole tour of were you in the San\nFrancisco office yes nice uh it's it's\nsuper cool did you like it yeah I loved\nit the view from the top floor is like\njust the best things um so you enjoyed\nthe uh software engineering internship\nyou came back now you started applying\nfor uh Google I mean you applied for\nfull-time positions and then you were\nlooking for senior positions because\nyou're like you know I'm I'm eligible so\nI want to break this apart even and two\nthings like I know we talked heavily on\nfirst part like job search but can we\ntalk about like for your clouds and\nsystem like what I feel like you have\nthis mindset confidence built in you at\nleast that's what I see like you because\nnot many people would apply to senior\nposition uh even right now if I were to\ngo and apply for like senior product\nmanager I'm like going to look at the\ndescription and I'll be scared like oh I\ndon't think I know this positions did\nyou\nwhen you were reading the description\ndid you feel those thing or you like oh\nI I know these things if there were\nseven eight requirements so first of all\nevery big tech company they'll have\ngeneric set of requirements so only when\nyou actually enter the team matching\nphase then you know what specific that\nteam does and what their requirements\nare so that way when I read the job\ndescription it was very generic and they\nrequired some goang experience some\nkubernetes experience that's it but when\nI actually entered the team team\nmatching phase they told me that we\nrequire crd experience and controllers\ndevelopment experience and all that\nstuff so when you read the job\ndescription even if you have three out\nof five matching stuff and you so\nbasically the number of years matters\nlike for example in companies like\nAmazon and even meta I guess they ask\nyou to check box or to take the check\nbox and if you don't have that they aut\nto reject you so uh applying there will\nnot help you but actually Ling in\ncompanies which don't have those check\nboxes then you can give it a shot\nbecause like 2 years or one year and 10\nmonths should be okay I mean should be\nmanageable as long as you can crack the\ninterviews and you can convince the\nhiring manager that you are a good F\ncool so it's so interesting because I\nwould think most people are more\ninterested in software engineering route\nbecause it's more safe and convenient\nthan the clouds and system so that is\ninteresting that you you explored and\nthen you liked it and you kept going\nbecause you were like okay this is this\nis fun this is I wouldn't choose\ncontrollers because it's like so scary\nand so it's like so much so much to\nremember but uh that's that's awesome\nwhat what are some of the roles you\nthink if people were to choose computer\nscience and they were to go to network\nand Cloud uh one do you agree with me\nthat there are lot there are a lot of\njobs and demand going to be in the\nfuture uh yes I would say but I would\nstill recommend like for example for me\nit's a software engineer role uh my job\nlike what I do will be more on the cloud\nside and writing controller side and if\nI want to actually go in a more Niche\nlike only controllers kind of job then\nthat'll help me but because I'll be\nwriting apis also which more or less\nevery de software engineer would do so\nif I want to transition to a software\nengineer role that will also help me so\nwhy I'm saying this is if you can\nactually when you are applying for a\nfull-time job if you can actually use a\nniche area like either security or\nnetworking and get a generic title like\na software engineer title then it'll\nreally help you and even like just to\ntalk in layman terms right the demand\nfor Java is a lot so if you have two\nyears of java experience use that\ninstead of just applying for jobs where\nthey say programming experience required\nor preferred programming languages Java\nWang C++ Etc so if you have a niche area\ngetting a call back for that Niche area\nis higher compared to applying to\ngenerate positions so that was exactly\nwhat I also did so although I'll be\nworking very heavily on the systems side\nthe job search strategy was to get a\nsoftware engineer role so the demand is\nthere and then the followup was going to\nbe like what are some of the skills\nrequired for what you are doing so my\nskill set is um kubernetes goang uh crds\nwhich are your customer resource\ndefinition and Cloud Technologies and\nyeah mostly that's it and all what what\nis cloud Technologies uh is it like\nAzure AWS Google Cloud yeah Google Cloud\nbecause Google uses their own internal\ncloud of course why would they use\nAmazon but uh yeah yeah we yeah we use\ngcp as well so we are your\ncustomers but um I believe there are\nthree main things which are like in a\nway required for to get a job one is\nyour resume one is your LinkedIn or like\nyour profile and the portfolio and there\nare two main ways to get it one is\nonline app like application and then\nreferrals so I know you went heavy on\nreferral side now talking about job\nsearch I feel like there are two main\nways and there are probably only two\nways one is just purely cold\napplications or online applications and\nand then second one is the referral like\nsomeone helps you get into the company I\nheavily rely on referals and I know you\nhave also used that path but before we\nget to that path let's talk about the\nonline application for online\napplication I feel like there's three\nmain things needed one is resume\nLinkedIn and your profile or your\nportfolio so let's start with your\nresume yeah sure so um so like there is\nthere are some applicant tracking\nsystems which give use some scores like\nfor example resume worded so just try to\nmake sure that your score is above 90 or\n95 but I think going above 95 is very\ndifficult and their recommendations are\nnot that great because they ask you to\nhave a number in almost every line of\nyour resume which is fine because most\ncompanies are using the ATS today to\nactually filter out your resume but um\nyeah I mean if you think logically that\nadding a number in this line is not\npossible then it's okay I mean getting a\na score of 19 92 should be fine and you\ncan expect to get filtered out but again\nthen getting even after you filter out\nthe ATS getting a call back is very\ndifficult because like almost thousands\nof candidates are using the same ATS\nsystems and they also have a very high\nscore so um yeah so for online tracking\nsystem U that score helps it sounds like\nyou look at the job description one like\nget a generic score uh get your resume\ntogether format it and all of that so\nfirst step is there second step is now\nthat you have resume in some some good\nspot now when you're applying look at\nthe job description would you I would\nrecommend but I'm want to see would you\nrecommend people to Custom Tailor it to\nthe job they're applying or they should\nthey just use generic one I mean if it's\na dream company you should but if we see\npractically like every person applies to\n500 600 applications and you do not have\nso much of time to personalize it to\nevery single job that you're are\napplying to so I had one basic template\nwhich had the actual so basically the\njobs which you would be applying to you\nwould be looking for similar things so\nthose keywords should be present in one\ntemplate of yours and then if it's a\ndream company and then they ask you two\nthree things extra in the job\ndescription then you can customize it\naccording to them and then send that\nresume but I did not put in so much of\neffort because um like internship time I\nwas even in inter sh I was not writing a\npersonalized tailored resume for every\nsingle company but um like when you do\nfull-time like when I was doing\nfull-time I had subsidized a very small\nset of companies and so for them I did\nthese things two or three times and um\nhow many companies did you apply 500\nduring internships yes I would say but\nfor full time I kind of knew very early\non in September that I would get a\nreturn offer from Salesforce and I was\nbut I did not have the letter in hand so\nI was applying to some companies\nrandomly without referals which were\nsmall companies and I did not bother\nmuch about them but for big companies I\nwas putting in the effort and I would\nsay I would have applied to like 15 big\ncompanies because I was sure just 15\nyeah because because I was sure that I\nwould get a return off and like 30 35\nsmall companies but uh if you do not\nhave anything in hand then you should\njust go crazy and applied to every\nsingle thing which you\nsee right right okay cool can we can we\nsee your resume and see like how you\nstructured it yes of course so um yeah\nso this is the doc version of my resume\nbecause I was a University graduate so\nlike I am still in University so I had\nmy uh education section first and then I\nhad these technical skills now again I\nwas looking specifically for Goan uh\nprogramming language\nso I had goang first but in some\ncompanies which they required C++ as the\nbasic language I had C++ first and then\ntools press apis is a keyword which\nyou'll find in every single job\ndescription for a software engineer if\nit's a backend role so you need to have\nthat then AWS git all these are very\ncommon actual Words which I pulled out\nfrom job description across companies\nand all of that is present in here this\nkind of helps my resume short list from\nthe ATS stage and then because I was\nlooking for cloud roles so I had cloud\ncomputing here and yeah these were\nthings which I was tting so someone for\nexample if they are a backend software\nengineer then they can put backend\nsoftware engineering here if that\nhelps yeah and then coming on to\nprofessional experience initially I had\na lot of stuff here like bracket some\ntechnologies and stuff but um eventually\nit became too congested and I feel\npeople would not have wanted to look at\nit so I kind of removed everything and\ntried to make it clean so that if a\nperson is just looking at it they're\nable to pick up keywords like for\nexample network security is something I\nam interested in so I just have that\nhere although putting a team so this is\nthe name of my team although generally\nmost people don't put it but because\nthis is the only thing that I'm putting\nin bold so I had the name of the team\nbecause it has the keywords which I\nwant and so yeah sure yeah and I I like\nthat um you even in your Salesforce uh\nexperience it doesn't have like a lot of\num quantifiable like you know helped\nwith revenue or cost or something like\nthat it purely is very technical like\nengineered of production ready\nmicroservices so that you could do this\num conducted experiment with you know I\nthink again you're using the keywords\neven in your bullet points which are\nthere in the job description so it's not\njust that putting it in the skill\nsection but how did you use your skills\nin the bullet points is very important\ncorrect right because if you just put in\nsome content here which does not really\nadd any value then it consumes a lot of\nspace on your\nresume yeah yeah and then again\nobviously in Walmart you actually have\nmore quantifiable like numbers what\nbasically yeah yeah\nso nice okay so then work experience and\nthen you went to projects okay gotta\nthen awards and achievements yeah and I\nwould definitely recommend this that if\nyou have some awards and achievements\ndefinitely put it as a separate section\nbecause most people don't have this\nbecause they do not have such uh\nachievements which they can put in a\nseparate this uh separate section but if\nyou have this your resume stands\nout yeah and another thing I noticed is\nthe GitHub link for each of your project\nwhich means you have hosted the code uh\nso that people can see like it's not\njust like you know words I can actually\ngo and see the code correct yeah and\nanother thing is like if you can like I\ndid not have space so if someone has\nyour paper resum they cannot really\nclick on this so if you can somehow put\nin some meaningful name so that if they\ncan just type that in if they do not\nhave your on online version of the\nresume cool okay so you did um so for\nonline obviously it's the resume and\nthen LinkedIn again we can people can go\nto LinkedIn and scan our as our LinkedIn\nprofile um and then comes the total\nportfolio which in your case portfolio\nis the GitHub profile lead code if you\nhave one those would be I would consider\nas a portfolio for product managers it\ncould be different things um anything\nwould you think of like for online\napplication is it just purely numbers\ngame job description I would say add as\nmuch details as you can add like for\nexample when you say portfolio I was\nconsidering it to be a website like I\nhave my own website which I have hosted\non GitHub and I really feel that even if\nyou have a very simple plain basic\nwebsite but have it because if you\nnotice in most of the applications they\nhave a specific field where they ask you\nfor your website URL initially I did not\nhave it but then I attended multiple\ncounseling this U multiple places where\nthe actual recruiters come and they give\nyou suggestions and tips so they have\nrecommended it thousands of times that\nyou should have a website URL because\nit's easier for the recruiter to glance\nand it's also easier and it kind of\ntells them that you are an enthusiastic\nperson and it's a simple web development\nproject they can just see like there are\nmultiple ways of Hosting you can just\nuse a notion page and host it but still\nhaving that shows them that you have\nsomething with some experience with web\ndevelopment so obviously have that and\nanother thing is um have your LinkedIn\nprofile up to date always because when I\nwas applying I saw multiple times that\nthe recruiters used to come to my\nprofile and see so as much content you\ncan fit in your LinkedIn it's the best\nand if you can actually be active like\nkeep posting of what you achieve now\nlet's talk about referral side which is\nwhere your strong suit is uh I'm\nassuming most of your interview you got\nwas through referral yes and I would\nalso say career fails help a lot because\nagain as I said in the beginning that\nyou need to reduce your competition\nspace so if if if you're uh going to a\ncareer fair then it's obvious that they\nare coming specific to your University\nand they have a they have the head count\nlike for example 20 students from UCSD\nwe are for sure hiring so even if you're\nnot that great in if you don't perform\ngreat in the interviews and all that\nstuff but they feel they have confidence\nin you then you have a chance there\nbecause it's easy to get a call back\nhere it's obvious that if you perform\nwell in the career fair or if you talk\nwell and if they impressed they will\ngive you a call\nback yes and it is such an\nunderutilized resource on campus Because\nPE I think for some reason stigma is and\npeople have made it a that nothing\nhappens in career fair no one gets a\ncall it's and I I've said this many\ntimes that I personally have gotten my\njob through career fair and I feel like\npeople just assume that they're not\nthere to hire you in this might come as\na surprise these companies who come to\nCareer Fair they actually have to pay\nUniversity to put a table on the career\nfair because I was part of the event as\nof my on campus job so they have to like\nin at least in ours like you know\nroughly 500 to, 1500 and even the more\nhigher they pay they get to choose where\nthey want to be in the career so again\nfrom think about from company's\nperspective they why would they come and\nspend money just to like be there like\nthey are they are there for a specific\nreason yes some seniors didn't get it\nthat doesn't mean you will not get it\nyou like and I I think what you\nmentioned is so important that you are\ncutting out so much competition because\nnow it's only specific to UC San Diego\nand no other universities is applying to\nthat maybe some people might sneak in\nbut at least it's very specific to your\nso out of 100,000 people now there's\nonly 500 people who are going to that so\nyou have much better chances or\nprobability so yeah I I agree and again\nprepare for career fair as well don't\njust go blindly have the list ready that\nthese are the companies I'm going to go\nto these are the things I'm going to\ntalk to here's my elevator pitch and\nthen so on yeah would you agree yes\ndefinitely because like when they come\nthey either give you a job description\nor you can just start with the first two\nlines which comes up when you write the\nname of the company on Google and see\nwhat you have which can completely align\nwith that and just try to start a\nconversation because when you start a\nconversation the recruiter will also say\nsomething and whatever they say just be\nsmart enough to pick one or two words\nwhich align with your profile from what\nthey say and show them that dude this is\nwhat you need and here is what I have\nwhich should be a perfect\nalignment yes yes did you did you get\nany interview calls from career fail yes\nI got uh so I got Arista networks with\nand it was just B I don't have a very\nstrong networking background but that\ncall back was just based on one single\ncourse and whatever I had learned from\nthat course which actually converted\ninto a interview okay so now I I know\none of the things you said is C emailing\nso there's C messaging uh on LinkedIn\nand then there's called emailing yes did\nyou do both or did you do one or the\nother I mean obviously you did the C\nmessaging on ledin which worked for you\ndid you also do the cold emailing when I\nwas trying for full-time jobs I did\nbecause then I knew that I have less\ntime because I started only in September\nand I was graduating in December and\nalso if you have like I knew I'll get a\nreturn offer from Salesforce so I knew\nthat if I accept that I cannot even\nreneg so I again even had a shorter\ntimeline so yeah I did cold email can\nyou explain what is cold emailing uh\nlike because I know cold messaging is\nlike you find a person you see the\nrelevance and then you message them like\nhow did you find people how did you find\ntheir email what email did you use and\nall of that so I would say seniors are\nyour best bet when it comes to this\nbecause if if you if your seniors have\nreceived received an interview or some\nrecruiter has contacted them they have\ntheir emails which they might be willing\nto share with you because they are your\nUniversity seniors and they understand\nwhat you are going through so again\npeople here are very much willing to\nhelp you just need to know what to ask\nhow to ask and be able to reciprocate\nwhen someone else needs you that's all\nyou need and so yeah they will have the\nemail IDs which will be helpful and if\nyou if the recruiter is asking you for\nanything you can also say that yes this\nis my senior and you can give your\nsenior reference that's absolutely fine\nand um then you get the email IDs and\nthen you message them and then you I\nmean email them and when you are\nemailing again be very very specific\ntell them that this particular job I am\ninterested in and show that these are\nthe projects which I have done which\nhave given me these skills and this\naligns with this particular requirement\nof your job description so the more uh\ncoherent and aligned it is the higher\nyour chances are wow okay so this is\ndifferent than what I was thinking I\nwasn't thinking um what you said so what\nyou're saying is you you look up your\nseniors and you're like okay this person\nhas gotten a job in Google so that means\nthis person have already talked to\nhiring managers and recruiters so you\nwould reach out to them and ask them\nlike hey if they're willing to share the\nemail of the recruiters and hiring\nmanagers yes and if they are then you\nCod email them saying like hey I got\nyour contact from so and so if you want\nto or you're purely C emailing like I\nfound your email and then you send them\nthat is an interesting strategy I I I\nthought what you were going to say which\nis also another strategy which works for\npeople and people have said that that\nhas worked for them is that you go you\nlook up um that okay this is the hiring\nmanager so you find a software engineer\nposition and sometimes LinkedIn will say\nlike okay this is the hiring manager so\nthen you go to some of the website where\nyou can find the email address from the\nwebsite right so you find the email\naddress and then you do the cold\nemailing which uh again is the same\nconcept but you're getting the email is\na different way which uh again that that\nis an interesting way to like I I never\nthought of it but now I was like oh yeah\nthat is that is smart I just feel like\nif people are willing to share like I\ndon't know if I would be willing to\nshare recruit so I would have probably\nhave to ask like hey can I share my\nshare your email with my friend or I\ndon't know yeah that is because you have\nalready entered into industry right like\nI am talking about my specific senior\nwho would have graduated like six months\nback and they would have been applying\nfor interviews and they would like you\ngot selected and you are in the first\nround or something those kind of\nconversations happen with the recruiter\nemail ID right so those email IDs uh I\nthink people are willing to share those\nat least I have seen that yeah right\nyeah yeah it just depends on how you\ncall email the recruiter so that way the\nperson who sent it uh is not like you\nknow shown in a bad light like hey you\nyou that's my personal identity why did\nyou reveal it kind of thing right so\nyeah yep here you go so this is a\nmessage which I had mail in fact a mail\nwow okay yeah it is big enough but it\neven if you just read the first line you\nlike understand so basically I I kind of\nassume that if I send this big of an\nemail the recruiter will not read full\nof it and might only be interested in\nthe first lines of it so in the first\nline I have the most important content\nwhere I'm saying that I'm currently a\nmscs student and in my most recent role\nI was a software engineering intern\nwhich means they know that I had an\ninternship and then I am telling that\nwhat I am interested in and what my what\nmy attitude is and all that stuff and\nthen what I am interested uh like which\nspecific roles I'm targeting that's it\nand then if they like the first\nsentences they can come and deep dive\ninto what other things I have or what\nspecific skill set I have so uh like\nwhen when I was in the team matching\nphase I had a very short timeline and\nthat's why I had a more specific cold\nemail for managers where I specified all\na lot of technicalities like um I was\nlooking for performance sensitive and\nimpactful projects and I'm pursuing uh\nMasters in computer science my uh\nspecialization is this and then all the\nbig terms like rest apis distributed\nsystems and going into more depth\nbecause the technical manager or the\nhiring manager will understand what the\nteam Works in actually and what the\nspecific skill set requirement is like\nthe recruiter might not understand these\nwords very well but the technical\nmanager might be on the lookout for\nthese so having these on an email to a\nmanager might again increase your\nchances Google has the team matching but\nuh I don't I think Amazon might have to\nI'm not sure like there are few\ncompanies who do team matching but not\nevery company has it so but again you\ncan use the same technique where people\nhave posted on uh LinkedIn right like\nyou can go to LinkedIn click on search\nand just say or like type hiring\nsoftware engineer and then there might\nbe hiring managers who have posted that\nnow you can get their email by using the\ntechnique I said um and then then email\nthem the same thing which again will get\nthe higher investment in terms of your\ntime and effort definitely yes call\nemail is your way to go call messaging\nis your way to go you ask them\nstraightforward you do a lot of the\nfrontend work and then uh hopefully some\nof them will respond I know not everyone\nwill respond um how what how did you\nlike motivate keep going motivate\nyourself like okay out of 10 people only\nin your case nine were responding so you\ndidn't really need motivation\nyeah but what advice would you say for\npeople who might not be getting\nresponses I mean I would say that you're\nnot the only one there are a lot a lot a\nlot of people and not just you people\nwho have been in the industry who got\nlaid off they are also going through the\nsame thing where they don't really get\ncall backs or responses but it's fine\nsomeday you will get the eye of the\nrecruiter and then things will\ncompletely change so you really need to\nkeep trying for that one one single\nopportunity which you need and yeah you\nwill be okay just keep going okay so now\nuh what is what was the preparation that\nyou did to do uh what kind of things you\ndid to prepare for it and then we'll\ntalk quickly about interview like rounds\nand all of that and then we'll go from\nthere okay what like what how did you\nprepare for this because obviously you\ntargeted like big companies Salesforce\nand Google and they have extensive\ninterview process so how did you prepare\nfor these so for fulltime um it'll be\nmore rigorous and it'll primarily be\nlead code so lead code prepare a lot\nlike 500 plus questions is a very normal\nthing like I would say almost everyone\ndoes it but don't go by the number go by\nthe quality of the questions like for\nexample I would suggest the blind 75 or\nthe 150 list because that has a very\ngood quality of questions and it's like\ndiverse like if you just do like I would\nsay I did not do anything much except\nfor the 150 list but I did do did that\nlist two three times so like if you do\nthe same question after 3 months you\nmight not remember exactly what the\nconcept was but if you keep practicing\nyour muscle memory gets it hard and then\nyou know how to apply it very well well\nso um I would really recommend that need\ncode 150 list and it's also great now\nbecause there are videos available so\nyou don't even need to keep struggling\nyou can time bound yourself and see the\nvideos which are really good and\nexplanatory so that you can learn from\nit and like after I started so first I\nwas doing lead code this need code 150\nlist and then after I started getting\ninterview calls so I was filtering by\nthe company and then trying to do the\nmost frequent ones like after you filter\nby the company also there are different\nuh filters then you try to um sort them\nby frequency and then do those like 30\nquestions of each company that'll be\ngood enough and uh the topics like\ngraphs and dynamic programming is a must\nmust must like I was asked dynamic\nprogramming in many interviews I know\nit's a very hard topic\npeople people are really scared about it\nbut uh like you can do it with practice\nnothing is that difficult which cannot\nbe achieved with practice I would say\ntry to build your profile and like try\nto explore a lot because you ultimately\ndon't want to be in a place where you\ndon't like working so try to explore\nwhat is the area you want to work in\nlive for it work hard work a lot hard to\nbuild a profile so that you can get what\nyou want and you got to keep hustle keep\nhustling love it I I love it yeah and\nand it all worth it for you I'm assuming\nnow now you feel like yes this was this\nmy hard work of two years coming to in\nUnited States in United States it was\nall worth it yes would you agree yes yes\nyeah I know the times you would feel\nlike giving up you would feel like okay\nthis is nothing is working out like I'm\nnot good enough there's going to be\nself-doubt coming in but you just gotta\nkeep smiling and you got to keep\nhustling like I say so um no that's\nawesome I forgot to ask you did did you\num because you were a googly and you\nobviously were confident you had\nSalesforce in your pocket as well so did\nyou negotiate your salary I did but my\nproblem was I had a very small time\nwindow because I had to either accept or\nuh reject Salesforce before um like I\ngot an offer from Google I mean\nbasically the timeline was closed so I\ndid not negotiate a lot my recruiter\njust asked me what your salary\nexpectation is and then he was trying\nand I quoted very reasonable values\nbecause I had done my market research\nlike when I say very reasonable it was\nnot lower but I knew that if I asked for\nthis they are going to give me at least\nconsider giving me that because I had\ndone a lot of research on level start\nFYI so um I quoted my values and then\nthey tried like in one round like my\nrecruit came back only once but then\nbecause the timeline was very short so\nthey on their end also they worked a lot\nand they tried to match as much as they\ncould to my expectations and then it was\npretty close and so I was okay with it\nso yeah I'm going to recommend everyone\nplease don't accept what they give you\nthis is the mistakes i' I've done they\nalways have a room to increase at least\n5,000 10,000 15,000 depending on the\ncompany uh and in ak's case it's\nprobably 100,000 200,000 so I'm just\nkidding but uh but like just don't\nexcept whatever your recruiter is you\nalways want to have at least you know 20\n30,000 more they will it's not that\nthey're going to say no they're going to\njust come back and say like hey we can\nonly do this much and then you know it's\nup to you to accept it or not but don't\naccept just as is is is what I was going\nto say but yeah this is uh I'm glad you\ndid negotiate and you're like you know I\nI negotiated I didn't have much time so\nI did negotiate only 300\n500 but uh this is awesome\nI'm I'm so glad we did this again thank\nyou akriti I can't wait to do UC San\nDiego experience because I think it's\ngoing to be fun to know that part of\nyour story and enjoy your India trip and\nonce you come back we'll film another\none but again thank you so much until\nour next one keep smiling keep hustling",

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7K72klxsD8",
    "transcript": "AOS first because you know krial well\nhow do you see this playing out do you\nbelieve this is kajal's Moment of Truth\nanti-corruption Crusader being arrested\nin a corruption case can he really claim\nthe moral High ground or is this end\ngame for\nkrial uh see aim I think it's ironical\nand it's rather tragic that the man who\nhas uh started a campaign and became a\nmessiah that fighting against the\ncorruption is now arrested under the\ncharge of corruption uh it's it's really\ntragic it's it's really ironical uh\nI I'm not here to to pass any judgment\nabout about the about about the degree\nof the case and how the case has been\nbut this was very very imminent from the\nday one I think the krial has been\nwrongly advised by the legal by by the\nlawyers uh the because this was never in\nmy opinion this was never a legal battle\nthis was more of a political battle and\nit was from the day one it was clear\nthat that that the tussle between the uh\nbetween the Amad party and the BJP will\npan out in a way that the the BJP would\nlike to see that the krial government in\nDelhi do not don't exist or Amad party\nsurrenders before the krial so so when\nthe first summon was given if if Arin\nkrial has appeared before before the Ed\nwould have been much much better because\nthen if if then arrested over there then\nhe could have easily said that look I\nI've been victimized but now in the\nDelhi High Court after looking into the\nevidences provided by the Ed and has not\ngiven any stay on the query action now\nand even after eight summons so Ed can\ngo ahead and the BJP can always say that\nthere is a\ns the high court agrees with with the\nevidences given by the given given by\nthe Ed so the high moral ground has gone\nfor a toss for him but one thing I would\nlike to say R very clearly that Amad\nparty might have a have have a plan that\nthey Arin krial can run the government\nfrom the jail but that is not going to\nhappen and it is it is again going to be\nanother blunder because the daily\nbecause central government is going to\nuh to to use article 376 and say that\nthe government in Delhi cannot be run\naccording to the Constitution there is a\ntotal constitutional breakdown a chief\nminister going into the jail the\ngovernment this is Unthinkable this is\nthis doesn't happen a minister going to\nthe jail is acceptable because the chief\nminister is there he reports to the\nChief Minister but if chief minister in\njail how how will you run the government\nright so I think again again it's a Arin\nkrial have no trust in any of his\nleaders ideally he would resigned would\nhave given charge to one of the senior\nleaders of the party who could have\nbecome the chief minister and would have\nrun the government now he is putting his\nown own own government in danger and\nthat can be be be more dangerous for the\narm because because Ash let me stop you\nbecause there are lots of angles that I\nwant to explore in this story one is the\nlegal angle what happens next legally\nthere's talk Sanjay Hegde of uh Arin\nkrial lawyers going to the Supreme Court\ntonight or certainly tomorrow morning uh\npleading that this coercive action\ncannot be taken but it's the prevention\nof money laundering act and we've seen\nunder the pmla very difficult to get\nbail certainly not relief is almost\nimpossible in most uh cases do you\nbelieve they have a case and if so what\ncan be the case Sanjay that they can\nhave well they may have believed that\nthey had a case but after an arrest uh\nthe events have overtaken the case that\nthey have already filed and I saw\nsomebody tweeting that there was some\nstatement from\nDr singu that they were not going to\nseek uh interim relief tonight I do I do\nnot know whether the so what are the\nlegal options what are the legal options\nyou think uh uh\nSanjay uh unless I'm proven wrong I\nthink the only legal option is to is to\nnow go through the procedure uh Mo move\nthe concern\nCourt in Rouse Avenue and and thereafter\nuh if they get bail there fine or or\nthen go through go to the high court and\nthen the Supreme Court the Lo dra out\nprocedure that has applied in the case\nof uh Sanjay Singh and the others may\nalso have to apply in this case but as\nwe've seen in the others they haven't\ngot bailed for months on end uh Manish\nsodia has been in jail since February\nlast year Sanjay Singh since October\nlast year Years it'll be two years in\nthe case of Manish sodia so you've got\nyou've got all these cases 14 months in\nthe case of man sodia in the case of\nsatendra Jen it is 2 years so you've got\na long extended period possibly Behind\nBars struggling to get bail for Arin\nkrial Shia chhat is outside the\nresidence of Arin krial what are you\nseeing around you sha section 144 impos\nwe can see pictures of Rapid action\nforce there tell us what you're seeing\naround you\nRaj rajdeep as we talk the road has been\nblocked by the protesters of the amadm\nparty I'll ask my cameraman to show you\nthe situation outside the the chief\nMinister's house once the news of the\ncm's arrest gave away the RO the kartas\nof the amadm party has now blocked the\nroads to see that they cannot probably\ntake uh their Chief ministers away this\nis the main road which will uh be\nleading towards the Ed because if the\nchief minister has to be brought out\nthis is the main road and now you see\nHeavy drama\nthe the protesters of the party now on\nthe\nstreets not in a mood to give an answer\nbut this is the\nsituation situation R the party k is now\non the streets blocking the road Delhi\npolice team moving him to uh detain the\nprotesters this is the main road that\nleads from the cm's residence towards\nthe uh the road that will take Arvin\nkrial after the arrest to the Ed\nheadquarters uh thank you very much\nthere sha we'll come keep coming back to\nyou getting more reactions uh from you I\nalso want to get uh reactions at the\nmoment from the am admy party guest\nsidat Sharma joining us at the moment\nsidat what's your first reaction to the\narrest of your leader there's much talk\nof a plan B if Mr kial is behind bars as\nSanjay said not easy to get bail under\npmla will you have someone else in line\nto become chief minister are you saying\nthere is no other leader that your party\nhas yeah let me at the very outset tell\nyou Raj that one of your colleagues uh I\nthink it was\nprti who said that am admy party reels\nin theatrics\nno I didn't say theatric one second okay\nwell let's focus on on yes go ahead\nsidat I asked you a St I'll be very\nlogical I'll be very logical yes what\nhas essentially happened today Election\nCommission of India published data of\nbjp's\n8,250 CR illegal funds BJP desperately\nneeded a headline change a visha guru\nturning out to be a wasi guru going into\npublic domain so they tried that now\nwhat has essentially happened today\nthere is a small uh uh sequence of\nevents I'll try to be very crisp and\nprecise within 10 senten sentences I'll\nend it arind krial challenged Ed notices\nto him the court gave Ed 22nd April to\nrespond Ed had earlier in its public\nrelations press release excise named Mr\nkrial as the top leader of am admy party\nparadoxically in court today the Ed said\nthat it has neither named him as an\naccused nor does it want to question him\nas an AAP leader going further Ed also\nsaid today that although it can arrest\nanybody any time but it has not so done\nso as of now so what has become clear\nwhat has changed in the interim now it\nis very clear that there was no money\nTrail found neither is arind krial and\naccused now Ed had two options today\neither respect the law and convince the\ncourt on April 22nd that arind krial is\na beneficiary beneficiary or respect BJP\nand arrest a constitutional figure who\nis neither an accused nor a beneficiary\naccording to its own admission now this\nwas a catch 22 situation for BJP and it\nhas fallen into that trap arrest\narresting krial BJP at your own Peril\nand it is confessing to the Panic of not\nhaving an answer to krial model of\ngovernance",

    "transcript": "has been condom off and the media has\nbeen shifted to one side and the Ed\nofficials shivangi the Ed officials have\nentered inside we saw uh the logo of the\nenforcement directorate in one of the\nfiles that was being carried by one of\nthe officers so this is in regard to the\nliquor gate and today the high court uh\nin a judgment had refused the plea that\nwas put in by Mr Arn krial asking that\nhe should get relief from any coercive\naction or arrest and after that plea was\ndenied we see enforcement directorate\ncoming here we know that Mr krial has\nbeen skipping multiple summons by the\nenforcement directorate there was a\nheated uh you know argument today in\nfront of the court where Mr krial\nCouncil abishek Manu singi went on and\nasked that in what capacity is Mr krial\nbeing summoned as the national Conor of\nthe arm army party as the chief minister\nof Arin krial to which uh the additional\nsolicit general said that he is being\ncalled as uh the person Mr Arin krial\nand nobody is above the law even if he's\nthe chief minister of the national\ncapital and which is why uh the Delhi\nCourt after a detailed hearing rejected\nThe Plea of Mr Arn krial the chief\nminister of the national capital and\njust couple of hours after that after\nthe plea was rejected we see uh that uh\nmassive team of the enforcement\ndirectorate has reached the uh the\nresidence of Mr Arin krial here in the\nciviles area of the national capital we\nsee that the enforcement directorate\nofficials have gone inside uh Republic\nTV is the only channel to be present on\nground and getting these exclusive\nvisuals uh from the residents of Mr Arin\nkajri while we the only Channel over\nhere on the ground bringing you the\nlatest update for our viewers and these\nexclusive visuals of enforcement d\ndorate coming at the residence of Mr irn\nkrial you can see that a massive\ndeployment of the Delhi police officials\nhas been put over here uh the\nbarricading has been done the media has\nbeen shifted at one side and the\nenforcement directorate the officials of\nthe enforcement directorate have entered\nthe residence of the chief minister of\nthe national capital Mr Arin krial this\nis after multiple summons have been sent\ntime and again for the past couple of\nmonths to Mr krial to appear uh in front\nof the enforcement directorate and\ncooperate with the interrogation and\ninvestigation uh in the liquor gate case\nbut we have seen that Mr Arn kajal has\nbeen uh dubbing the entire investigation\nin the liquor gate as Vendetta and has\nbeen skipping the sermons we'll take you\nback to the visuals over here remember\nRepublic TV is the only channel that is\npresent on the ground bringing these\nexclusive visuals for viewers where the\nenforcement directorate after the Delhi\nHigh courts uh are High Court snubbed\nThe Plea that was uh uh that was moved\nby Mr Arin krial seeking uh protection\nfrom uh any coercive action specifically\narrest uh we have the team of the\nenforcement directorate here at the\nresidence of Mr Arin kajal what's going\nto happen we'll be bringing that for our\nviewers as well but yes this is the\nlatest development the breaking at the\nmoment that enforcement directorate a\nhuge team of Mr of enforcement\ndirectorate has reached the residence of\nDelhi chief minister Mr Arin krial and\nyou can see that how the entire area has\nbeen condoned off there's nobody seen on\nthe road over here at civiles where his\nresidence is and massive deployment of\nthe Delhi police uh over here in front\nof the residents what's going to happen\nnext is yet to be seen but yes uh today\nthere was an important hearing where Mr\nkajri wal put in a\nbid to put in on the bed and now you can\nsee that there's a heavy deployment of\nthe police officials over here oh heavy\ndeployment of the police officials over\nhere the enforcement director team has\nreached and they are inside we are\nbringing you these visuals from outside\nthe residence of the chief minister\nthese are the exclusive visuals that\nonly Republic TV being on the ground in\nfront of the residence of Mr Arin krial\nwhere the enforcement directorate has\narrived\nwe are showing you a 360° view of how\nthe entire area is being secured by the\nDelhi police officials you can see that\nuh there's the Convoy of the Delhi\npolice officials and\nand and we see that how the police has\ncondoned off the entire area now we are\nbeing uh joined by a senior editor\nShaban sen uh shaan the enforcement\ndirectorate team has reached here at the\nresidence of Mr Arin krial and this is\nhappening just a couple of hours after\nthe high court rejected his flea that\nsought protection from coercive action\nshab well in fact we are now given to\nunderstand that the enforcement director\nteam has gone in with the search warrant\nthis after no interim protection was\ngranted to Delhi chief minister Arvin\nkrial what cannot be denied at this\npoint in time that the enforcement\ndirector will actually take a decision\non whether or not to take coercive\naction against Arin K the reason being\nbecause remember in the arguments that\nwere put forth by the enforcement\ndirector in the Delhi High Court they\nhad made it abundantly clear that there\nis no question of giving any sort of\nverbal Assurance with regards to interim\nprotection to be granted uh to Arvin\nkrial remember he hasn't complied with\nabout nine summons that were sent out by\nthe enforcement directed pertaining to\nthe lior cam they were asking Arin krial\nto explain whether at all his party has\nreceived allegedly received Kickbacks in\nthe liquor scam running into crores of\nrupees this was what they said proceeds\nof crime that was generated from the\nliquor scam over a period of two years\nput together remember in the\ninvestigation that has been carried out\nso far several arrests have been made\nbut the key takeaways from the\ninvestigation is this number one with\nregards to the first statement that was\nrecorded by the enforcement directorate\nthat was of accused sabir mahindru it is\nhe who in his statement made the first\nmention of Arvin krial saying that there\nwas a FaceTime call between Arvin krial\nand Vijay n along with sair Mahindra\nwhere Vijay n communication manager was\nintroduced to him as his boy the second\nstatement was recorded of a witness in\nthis particular case that is ysrcp\nmaguna Rd maguna Redd in his statement\nto made a similar assertion that there\nwere meetings that took place with Arin\nkrial and the blessings were actually\ngiven by Arvin krial with regards to the\ndraft policy remember the draft policy\nalso the changes that were brought into\nthe exchange of those documents took\nplace at the residence of the chief\nminister that is the reason why they say\nthat the chief minister was actually\nwell aware of the fact that these\nchanges that were brought into the draft\ninto the excise\npolicy the\ngroup\nonce\nagain third aspect is with regards to\nthe fact that whether at all the party\nactually\nreceived Goa election because remember\nan outdoor advertising company received\nmoney in cash which the\nenforcement is the money that was\nreceived during the leakers scam and was\nutilized for the Goa election\ncampaigning not just Goa election\ncampaigning they also suspected that\nmoney was actually used in the Punjab\nelections and as the national convenor\nof the party it is Arvin\nkrial funds and to explain how did they\nactually received the fund believe the\nlarge amount of the transactions taken\nplace but was also recorded by\nthe\nand the fact that there are witnesses\nwho have taken the name of Arin krial\nincluding the accused that is the reason\nwhy time and again the enforcement\ndirector has been maintaining that it is\nimportant that Arvin krial actually\njoin and you see what is it that the\nsitting chief minister has to say about\nthe summons that were issued to all\nthese basically said that these are sums\nwhich are illegal in nature only because\nthe enforcement directed not tell Arin\nkrial whether at all he was being called\nin as a suspect or as a witness in this\nparticular case once again this happens\nto be the prerogative of the agency\nwhether or not to inform the person if\nhe's being called as a suspect or as a\nwitness all right let's go to Madura as\nwell Mima is joining us live right now\nMima take us through exactly uh you know\nwhat is happening right now now the\nraids are happening at kiva's home that\nis what we are learning of raids are\nhappening searches are happening do we\nhave any inside details about what could\npossibly be happening\ninside well shangi remember that this is\nan investigation in the liquor gate and\nmultiple multiple leaders of the arm\nadmy party along with the workers of the\narm admy party have already been\narrested and are\nand are behind the bars and remember\nthat their detailed interrogation has\nalready happened and now the Crux of it\nneeds to be kept in front of Mr krial\nand which is why he has been skipping\nthe summons and today after the high\ncourt had given that order of cohesive\naction uh against uh Mr krial we have\nenforcement directorate over here\nconducting searches at the residence of\nMr uh Arn krial and now for how long\nwill this begin we'll have to wait and\nwatch but uh Republic TV is the only\nChannel over here on the ground bringing\nyou these exclusive visuals you can see\nthat the amount uh that that that the\nsize of uh the deployment of the police\nofficials over here request my camera\nperson to just show you around that\nheavy deployment of the Delhi police\nofficials over here in front of the\nresidence of Mr arjin Arn kri while it\nis just some half an hour back that all\nof a sudden there was a massive Convoy\npar in front of the residents of Mr Arin\nkrial and out of those cars came out\nenforcement directorate officials along\nwith uh you know uh along with many\nDelhi police officials and these are the\nexclusive visuals that we are bringing\nuh for viewers as you can see that this\nConvoy the number of cars that are\nstanding here or are parked here are of\nuh the enforcement directorate and Delhi\npolice officials and looking at the\nseriousness we see you see that how the\nbarricading of the entire area has been\ndone in front of the residents of Mr\nArin kajri while what needs to be seen\nhere is that the news is tightening\naround the chief Minister's neck over\nhere because uh even if uh we go back to\nthe hearing that happened today uh it\nwas submitted by the enforcement\ndirectorate that they have enough\nevidence and that which is why they have\nbeen sending multiple summons to the\nChief Minister but he's been skipping\nthem and today we have the enforcement\ndirector at the doors of Mr Arin krial\nand the searches are happening the\nenforcement directorate is going to scr\nuh through the residence uh for any\nevidence may it be hard or may it be\ndigital so all that will be scrunched\nand ComEd out by the enforcement\ndirectorate on the basis of the previous\ninvestigation and then interrogation of\nmultiple people who've been even\narrested and have been interrogated in\nthe liquor gate so we'll have to wait\nand watch as to what really happens for\nhow long uh this uh entire search uh\ncontinues but yes this is a massive\ndevelopment taking in the national\ncapital and the News tightening around\nMr Arn krial the chief minister of uh\nthe chief minister of Delhi and the\nnational Conor of the arm admi party uh\nnow the arm admy party has been dubbing\nthe entire investigation of the liquor\ngate as Vendetta but the enforcement\ndirectorate uh has uh has abundantly\nclear and has kept it in front of the co\nCourt as well that they have enough\nevidence against Mr krial and which is\nwhy these summons are being sent which\nhave been regularly skipped by Mr krial\nbut today uh in a massive development we\nhave enforcement directorate coming here\nreaching at the residence of uh the\nDelhi chief minister they've gone inside\nit's been uh over 30 minutes it's been\naround 45 minutes to be precise shivangi\nthat the enforcement directorate reached\nher uh at the residence of uh the Delhi\nchief minister taking you back to the\nvisuals as you can see that the\ndeployment of the Delhi police officials\nis heavy the barricading has been done\nthe entire area has been gone off\nnobody's seen on the road looking at the\nseriousness of the matter the\nenforcement directorate officials uh\nthere was a massive team of around 10\npeople that reached here at the\nresidence of the chief minister you can\nsee that uh this these visuals that we\nare bringing is of the Bungalow of the\nchief minister Mr Arin krial here at the\nCivil area of the national capital\nand\nmy\nLord fa\nset\nbreing\nnew\nBP\nthey have done nothing\nwrong getting in breaking news and the\npictures of the enforcement director\nteam at Arin kajal's residence we have\nthe first pictures coming in Republic TV\non the ground we are tracking the\nsituation live from outside Arin kajal's\nDelhi residence our reporters are live\non the field you're looking at the first\npictures those are the first pictures of\nthe heavy police presence at Delhi K\nral's residence I'm also getting getting\nacross my colleague abishek kapor\njoining us live uh hours after hours\nafter hours after he was denied any\nrelief abishek and shaan abishek he's\nbeen raided by the enforcement\ndirectorate he ducked at least nine\nsummons uh shaan is also live shaan\nwhat's the is this a raid is this a\nsearch are they just handing him another\nsummon what's going\non well in fact a short while back the\nconfirmation that we got from our\nsources is that the searches would also\nbe carried out but as I understand uh\nthat they would be also carrying the\nwarrant along with them for the searches\nto be carried out uh in all likelihood\nthere's also possibility that they would\nbe issuing yet another suburn if at all\nif at all the searches do not heeld much\nresult remember both the options are\nessentially open at this point in time\nthis is being monitored by the top\nofficers here in the national capital\nthis comes in after a decision that was\nbasically taken by the legal team of the\nenforcement directorate that there were\nscathing remarks that were actually made\nby the Delhi High Court which would\neffectively mean there was there was no\nthere was no interum protection that was\ngranted to Arvin krial to begin with\nwhich essentially means that he has to\nappear before the enforcement director\nand also just to put this into\nperspective he was actually asked to\nappear today by the enforcement director\nso the nth suon that was actually sent\nto Arin krial was asking him to appear\nbefore the agency today but armb party\nhas been maintaining that since the\nmatter is subj and the fact that this\nwas coming up before the high court\nthere is no question why kri should be\nbasically respond to the summons that\nhave been sent out now without any\nprotection remember there is a\npossibility to that the enforcement\ndirector could actually take the\ndecision of taking a coercive action in\nthis entire matter because they also\nbelieve that somewhere down the line he\nhas not been cooperating uh despite\nmultiple opportunities being given to\nthe chief minister to explain his\nposition as well as his party's position\non the allegations that have been\nleveled against him and his\nparty we're taking the live pictures\nwe're hearing that they presented a\nsearch warrant that they presented a\nsearch warrant Shaban those are the\ndetails available with us that they have\na search warrant

is a strategy by the BJP of\ncourse the same old the same old lines\nbeing repeated the political line of the\namadm party has been that\nthis is a strategy of the BJP to try and\nlimit Arin\nquesal in Delhi and in Punjab getting\ninto more details right now shaan\nconfirming right now shaan is confirming\nright now Arin kajal is being questioned\na joint director rank officer a joint\ndirector rank officer has reached\nkajal's residence two senior officers\npart of the investigation are at Arin\nkajal's residence in the liquor scam in\nthe excise policy money laundering case\nexcise policy money laundering case\nquestioning will be done by an\ninvestigative officer searches and\nquestioning I repeat searches and\nquestioning of the chief minister is\nhappening simultaneously as we speak so\nthis is a very very critical night for\nArin kial it's been a it's been a scary\nscary last few days for him in the\ncourts he faced setback after setback\nafter he decided to evade summons not\nonce not twice not three times four\ntimes five times as many as nine times\nright now and the enforcement\ndirectorate on his tail they're on his\ntail and seven to eight of them are\ninside the residence of Arin kival\nquestioning him some are questioning him\nand some are searching his residence\nthat's a confirmation that I have that's\na life shot life shot from the Republic\nTV cameras Republic TV Republic bat\nRepublic banga Republic Canada all four\nchannels outside the residence of Arin\nkrial searches and quizzing\nsimultaneously happening and all of that\njust just before the elections of\n2024 in the national capital Arin kajal\nhas struck a deal with the congress\nparty he won't be fighting alone\nallocating a few seats to the congress\nparty but this is going to have\nelectoral electoral impact for Arin\nkrial more than political strategy for\n2024 his team is busy now with legal\nstrategy shaan shaan what's the plan\nwhat's the plan what's going on\ninside information now coming in from\nTop sources that two c officers are part\nof the investigation they have also\nreach the residence of the chief\nminister seares are already underway\njust to explain the process of what's\nreally happening right now the\nenforcement directorate team led by\njoint director rank officer along with\nhim an assistant director Bank officer\nthey have entered the chief Minister's\nresidence with a search warrant so the\nsearch has already begun now remember if\nat all any recovery is actually made uh\nimmediately thereafter an explanation is\nbasically sought from the person\nconcerned this particular matter it is\nArin krial he will have to basically\nexplain while the searches are underway\nfor instance if any particular material\nis seized by the enforcement director\nthat explanation will also be taken or\nsought from the from the person\nconcerned that is the chief minister\nremember this is a little different than\nwhat would have happened when K would\nhave gone to the enforcement\ndirectorates headquarters where his\nstatement is recorded under Section 50\nof the pmla act that is different than\nwhat's currently happening as we speak\nbecause the searches are on and\nexplanation is basically sof from the\nchief minister now with regards to\nwhether at all the enforcement directed\nwill take any coercive action remember\nthat is a decision that\nperhaps\nAR\nshaan is it the first time that he's\nactually being questioned they called\nhim he didn't respond to the summons\nthey've gone to his residence and he the\nfirst time that he's been questioned is\nis is that is that correct is that\nfactually\ncorrect well that's absolutely right\nthis is for the first time that Arvin\nkrial is being questioned by the\nenforcement director\nthe previous appearance that he had made\nthat was before the Central Bureau of\nInvestigation remember there he was\ncalled in as a witness in this entire\nmatter and his statement was recorded by\nthe Central Bureau of Investigation this\nis quite different than what we saw the\nlast time when he had appeared before\nthe CBI because in this particular case\nthe enforcement director has gone a step\nfurther they have come on record in the\nthe remand notice in the remand copy\nthat was accessed by Republic TV during\nk remand they had categorically made a\nmention of the fact that kav along with\nthe chief minister of Delhi and the then\ndeputy chief minister Manish sodia had\norchestrated the lia Scamp they had come\non record to say that tweeted this in a\nstatement a day after and the statement\nwas released to the public and in which\nonce again they made a mention that this\nwas a deal that was orchestrated by\nkrial and K Kavita this is for the the\nfirst time that the searches are also\nbeing carried out at the residence of\nthe chief minister it's a sitting chief\nminister whose residence the enforcement\ndirectorate is carrying out the searches\nwhile the searches are underway his\nstatement is also being recorded but the\nstatement that is recorded is procedural\nin nature because remember any item that\nis seized by the enforcement directorate\nand explanation is essentially sought by\nthe agency and that's exactly what is\nhappening as we speak right now slipping\ninto a short pick we continue with this\nbig Development coming in from the\nnational capital where the chief\nminister is being questioned by the\nenforcement\ndirector Ami has been ranked India's\nnumber one private university for the\n11th year by India Today a

that\nwithin an hour of the Court issuing\nnotice they arrived at the residence of\nArin kial and that it shows that Ed is\nnot an independent investigative agency\nit's a political weapon of the BJP\nstated lines repeated each and every\ntime he's received a summon from the\nenforcement\ndirector in other news Amad party\nworkers also chaging protests outside\nthe residence of Delhi chief

vinit Goa\nis connected with us right now wi Goa he\ncould have he could have evaded all of\nthis I mean it's election season this\nwas not required they called you 9 times\nyou could have gone the first time you\ncould have gone the second time three\ntimes four times 5 6 7 8 nine\ntimes nine times and then you can't cry\nfoul G ramam to you ramam to all my cop\nAlis and all the viewers who are\nwatching me right now it's a classic\ncase of CH or Cena JY somebody who is\ninvolved in the cartel somebody who has\nformed the cartel knowingly somebody who\nbenefited out of that pushed all the\ndelites to become addicted pushed young\nchildren to become addicted now he's\ntrying to fly F he was given chance once\ntwice Thrice more than nine times\nchallenge instigated the agencies I wish\nthis is not only a surge I wish this is\nnot only a rate as a common citizen of\nthis Delhi I wish this culprit is\narrested Justice is given to him you\nknow he increased the number of shops\nincrease the number of hours of sale\nincrease the commission from 2% to 12%\ndecrease the number of dry days decrease\nthe age of drinking purely because he\ncould get money in Hindi they\nsay how could you sleep at home when you\nforce others kid to drink I think he\nshould get Justice I wish I repeat my\nwish once again as a common citizen of\nuh Delhi that he's arrested is exposed\nyou know so that you know people still\nhave faith in\nLa that's a that's a moral argument vit\nthat's a moral argument let me tell you\none thing that's a moral argument right\nif you had told me that he should be\ntried for uh for allegedly receiving\nKickbacks I would have said yes but\nyou're giving a moral argument and uh I\ndon't want to get into that because\nthere are BJP governments in different\nstates where different Lev is given to\ndifferent kinds of Industries I won't\ntalk about that I'm going across to\nshaan as well shaan shaan what's the\nupdate shaan is on the on the spot\noutside kajal's residence shaan what's\ngoing on uh he's challenging Ed even now\nwhen they're inside his residence and uh\nhearing that he's refusing to go to the\nEd office he's challenging the Ed at\nevery stage through every summon\nShaban well in fact let me just quickly\ngive you a sense of what's really\nhappening outside the res of the chief\nminister now there's two layers of\nsecurity that has been brought in right\nnow you can see this is the barricading\nthat is essentially been done outside\nhis resident that's the first layer of\nsecurity brought in and thereafter what\nyou see through the back gate the black\ngate right now on the other side is\nwhere the chief Minister's residen is\nthat that area has been completely\ncordoned off and the latest update also\ncoming in right now uh n is the fact\nthat the enforcement director has sought\nfor additional security outside their\nheadquarters so there is security that\nis going to be brought in outside the\nenforcement director headquarters so it\nthere appears right now as I speak\nbecause a short while back on my way to\nthe chief Minister's residence I was\ntrying to get more information with\nregards uh to what exactly the\nenforcement directorate is up to it\nturns out uh that the top officers are\nin a huddle at this point in time it is\nbeing closely monitored now with regards\nto what is happening inside the chief\nMinister's residence what we can tell\nyou is that the enforcement director had\ngone inside with a search warrant this\nalong with at least two of the senior\nofficers who were present starting with\nthe joint director rank officer along\nwith him an assistant rank assistant\ndirector rank officer who's also present\na clear indication of the fact that the\nenforcement director perhaps has already\nmade up their mind with regards to what\nwould be the next logical step in their\nentire investigation the reason why it\nstems from the fact that there has been\nnon-compliance with the summons that\nhave already been issued and not one we\nare talking about at least nine summons\nthat have been issued uh to Arin krial\nthat is the reason why remember they\nhave to take a logical decision at this\npoint in time which perhaps could be a\ncoercive action that could be taken in\nthe next 30 to 35 minutes or little uh\nlater because given the fact that the\nsearches are still underway so there\nwould be seizure that could take place\nand as there have been also development\ntaking place right now slogan earing\nthat's actually taking place not very\nsure whether they are just Amad party\nsupporters or you would also have um a\nfew other leaders who are also coming in\nnone of the senior leaders right now\nhere at the second level of uh at the\nsecond level of uh the barricading that\nhas been been done the senior senior\narmad party uh leaders including s baj\nwho spoke to the media just a short\nwhile back basically indicated that they\nare not being able to communicate with\nArvin krial which is which is exactly\nwhat happens when the searches are\ncarried out because remember uh what\nwould essentially happen is that the\nseizure would take place including the\nelectronic devices that's exactly what\nhas happened uh that's exactly what\nhased in this\nparticular also currently as you can see\nthere is a lot of Sling that's taking\nplace outside his resid at this point in\ntime with some of the party workers also\nnow coming in clearly indicating the\nfact that you know there is a bit bit of\na nervousness within the Amad party Camp\nto given the fact that they fear that a\ndecision would be taken by the\nenforcement director to take coercive\naction against Arvin krial now this is\nthese are the developments that are\nbegin let me just quickly once again\ntake take you through what's currently\nhappening right now as the number of the\ndeployment that has been brought in\nwhich is also been increased so there is\na high possibility that as the searches\nactually complete let me just repeat\nthis and we can also put this out as the\nsearches complete the statement is\nalready been recorded but that is\nabsolutely different and that is not\nwhat satisfies the investigation that is\nthe reason why right now the focus would\nessentially be to complete the searches\nand thereafter take the decision of\ntaking a coercive action in this entire\nB which could actually result uh in yet\nanother arrest in this particular case\nI'm saying this uh with some amount of\nresponsibility given the fact that the\ndevelopments that have taken place let\nme quickly take you through what really\nhas happened inside the enforcement\ndirector soon after the hearing that\ntook place over the last 24 to 48 hours\nthe discussion that was actually\nhappening with the legal team of the\nenforcement director was this that they\nhave to basically impress about the\ncourt\nbut ma'am n sumon skipped very very\nclearly and categorically High Court\nalso went on to say that no coercive\naction would be you know not granted to\nMr Arin krial is it not flouting of the\nlaw see this entire matter is going on\ninto the court and still\ntoday see the court has given the notice\nto the Ed and Ed is supposed to answer\non 22nd of April so why there is so\nhurry why there is so hurry and why such\nkind of Rage in the capital city of\nDelhi with the CM is happening and see\nhow how much of the police has been\ndeployed but ma'am if you see the trag\nof events there were\nn\nnext\ninform\n[Music]\nupdates coming in right now special\ndirector special director has reached\nthe enforcement directorate headquarters\nshaan Sen getting us more breaking news\nupdates right now that a critical\nmeeting has begun at the enforcement\ndirectorate headquarters right now as we\nspeak enforcement directorate\nheadquarters is where a special meeting\nis on senior officers part of the\nmeeting in the headquarters is what\nwe're getting to understand senior\nofficers are part of the meeting in the\nheadquarters of the enforcement\ndirector seizures have been made I\nrepeat seizures have been made so we\nhave breaking news updates coming in\nright now seizures have been made for\nthe first time we have some update on\nthe story after the enforcement director\nteam reached Arin kajal's residence\nelectronic devices have been seized I\nrepeat electronic devices have been\nseized that's a breaking news update\nthat I have electronic devices seized\nfrom Arin kajal's\nresidence seizures have been made Senior\nofficers are part of the meeting at the\nheadquarters\nin enforcement\ndirectorate a meeting is underway and\nthe enforcement directorate headquarters\nhas been informed about the seizure that\nhas now been made backto back minute by\nminute breaking news updates in the case\nof Arin krial who's been asked to go to\nthe enforcement director office the\nenforcement director office has tried to\ntake him they've told him that he should\ngo with them and even at this stage he's\nchallenging the enforcement director\nrefusing to go to the enforcement\ndirectorate office electronic devices\nelectronic\ndevices have been\nseized in Arin kajal's\nresidence headquarters has been informed\nabout the seizures made shaan is back\nhe's picking up the minute by minute\nupdate\nshaan shaan what more are you hearing\nshaan well at the latest update now\ncoming in uh top sources now indicating\nthere is already a meeting that has\nbegun in the headquarters in the\nnational capital u of the enforcement\ndirector top level offices which also\nincludes the special director part of\nthat particular meeting so there is a\npossibility a decision will be taken\nvery soon on what perhaps could be the\nfuture of sitting chief minister arvind\nkrial in this entire matter let me also\nquickly point this out that about 4 to\nfive mobile phones have already been\nseized by the enforcement director at\nthis point in time that is one of the\nreasons why I remember uh that brief it\nappears that there has been a brief\naltercation uh with the chief minister\non this entire matter because remember\nwhen the statement was being recorded he\nwas essentially explained that this is\nessentially a procedural matter that any\nitem that is taken into the possession\nof the agency an explanation is\nbasically sought it's a form it's a kind\nof a punch Nama if I may say so but\nthat's not the exact term that is\nactually used but just for the benefit\nof our viewers it's a form of punchnama\nthat is actually done where you take\ninto the details of all the items that\nhave been uh taken into uh custody by\nthe enforcement directorate and as we\nspeak the meeting has already begun so\nexpect that some decision would be taken\non this entire matter as of now what I'm\nalso picking up that no summons were\nactually carried along with this\nparticular team as of now uh remember\nthose summons can if at all the\nenforcement director after this meeting\nactually takes the call of sending out a\nsomeone that can be issued uh you know\nat the at the very spot itself but as of\nnow uh there appears to be the Focus\nright now appears to be on the searches\nthat are being carried out because right\nnow behind me what you're essentially\nseeing is that the searches are\nbasically underway you have roughly over\na dozen uh members of the enforcement\ndirector team they were headed by The\nJoint director and assistant director\nwho have basically enter we I'm told\nthat BJP is\nreacting\nfor\nprop\n[Music]\nRel\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nwell in fact that's the latest cabet BJP\nsharply reacting on the statements that\nhave been made by Amad party leader s\nbhw a short while back has already\ndeclared that the Amad party essentially\nbelieves that Arvin Kwal would be\narrested and in fact they've gone a step\nahead saying that the government of\nDelhi will actually operate from inside\nthe prison now remember that's the claim\nthat has been made by the armad party at\nthis stage but just let me just quickly\nstick to the facts of this entire matter\nthe reason why ladies and gentlemen\nyou're essentially looking at this kind\nof an action being taken by the\nenforcement director is only after about\nnine summons that were actually issued\nto the sitting chief minister the reason\nwhy he was sa was to so that he could\nactually explain whether at all as the\nparty convenor was he actually aware\nthat his party had allegedly\nreceived Kickbacks in the liquor camp\nnow that's the explanation that that was\nactually sought from the chief minister\nby the enforcement directorate but right\nnow uh keeping in mind that the matter\nhad already reached the court uh a\ncomplaint was filed by the enforcement\ndirectorate about non-compliance of the\nsummons that were issued and thereafter\nremember the court had basically asked\nArvin krial to appear in person and\nthat's the appearance that was actually\nmade not before the agency but before\nthe court and thereafter remember this\nwas also challenged by arvind krial in\nfact the latest coming in earlier this\nmorning when a fresh petition that was\nactually filed by Arin kajal's legal\nteam in the Delhi High Court seeking\ninterim relief interim protection in\nthis particular case remember the high\ncourt had already indicated that they\nare not inclined to provide any sort of\ninterim protection or interim relief to\nthe sitting chief minister Paving the\nway for the enforcement director to take\nsome sort of action in this entire\nmatter this is for the first time that\nyou're essentially looking at the\nenforcement directorate uh perhaps\ncarrying out searches what you see just\nbehind me I'll just step aside and just\ngive you a quick look now we are just\nabout a few meters away from the chief\nMinister's residence right now this is\nuh perhaps the entrance that you see\nabout a few meters 50 m down the this\nparticular road is where the chief\nMinister's residence is and where the\nsearches are being carried out the\nreason why we are not being allowed to\ngo in right now because there's a large\namount of security that has been brought\nin this has now been divided into\nmultiple layers the black gate that you\nsee right now has been shut and this is\nthe yet another barricading that has\nbeen done as you can see right now this\nis how it looks like outside uh the\nresidence of the chief minister as we\nspeak a number of journalists along with\nAmad party workers all have basically\ncome into the picture right now what's\nimportant to point out here is that the\narm ADI party has essentially declared\nthey say that they are aware of the fact\nthat the enforcement director will be\narresting the chief minister as as far\nas the enforcement director goes no such\ndecision has been taken as of now but\nwhat I can tell our viewers ahead of\nothers that the enforcement director\ncurrently having a meeting at the\nheadquarters there has already been a\nseizure that has been made in this\nparticular case roughly about 4 to five\nelectronic devices have already been\nseized by the uh enforcement directorate\napart from that a tablet to has been\ntaken into custody by the enforcement\ndirector what we do not know at this\nstage is whether at all any documents\nhave been seized by the enfor M director\nwhether at all any other items have been\nseized or not that Clarity perhaps\nlikely to come in a little later about\nanother 30 minutes or so is what we are\nlooking at for fresh development to\nactually take place I'm told uh that the\nreporters who are also inside have all\nbeen asked to immediately leave from\nthere so there is an expectation there\nis an expectation right now that perhaps\nthe enforcement director could actually\ntake some sort of an action in a short\nwhile from now is what we are picking up\nso we'll have we are closely monitoring\nwhat's really happen happening Nan if\nyou can also perhaps take over for a few\nminutes as I could also get in some more\ninformation from my sources with regards\nto what has really happened because this\nis the crucial meeting uh that is\nbasically underway right now in the\nnational capital at the enforcement\ndirectorates headquarters where we are\ngiven to understand that the current\ndirector along with the other C officers\nwhich includes the special director all\nare currently in a huddle and remember\nuh that's where the decision is\nessentially made and just take a look at\nwhat's the uh mood right now outside the\nresidence of the chief minister there is\nadequate deployment that has been done\nyou have the rapid action force that has\nbeen brought in this is on the left hand\nside of the chief Minister's residence\nuh this is the kind what you see right\nnow this is the kind of deployment that\nhas been done uh I must say that this\nkind of a deployment is certainly an\nindicator this is certainly an indicator\nof the kind of preparations that have\ngone into and something that the\nenforcement director has already looked\ninto as I understand uh roughly around\n7:30 this evening is when uh I did\nmanage to speak to one of my sources\nwithin the enforcement director where\nthey said uh that yes the future course\nof action has already been decided uh\nafter after what we were given to\nunderstand after the developments that\ntook place in the Delhi High Court which\nwas uh you know perhaps a shot in the\narm for uh the enforcement director to\nactually decide what perhaps could be\nthe next step of action uh in this\nparticular case that's when uh little\nlater a little later around 7:45 7:30\n7:45 is when the decision was actually\ntaken to enter the chief Minister's\nresidence they had carried along with\nthem the search warrant because that\nbecomes important right now uh for the\nenforcement director to carry out the\nsearches that's where the searches are\nessentially uh taking place and uh the\ndevelopment that has taken place so far\nis that they have been able to seize\ncertain electronic items what we cannot\nconfirm at this point in time is whether\nat all any documents pertaining uh to\nthe the lickup policy whether that has\nbeen seized by the enforcement directed\nor not that is still not very clear\nwe'll still stay with those a quick\nglimpse of what's really happening there\nuh and then perhaps we could also go\nback uh to the reg for a short while so\nthat I can also get you some more\nupdates that are coming in fastpac\ndevelopments actually taking place right\nnow uh here outside the chief Minister's\nresidence shaan I'm giving you a one\nwhat I'll give you a 60c breather I'm\njust uh going through the details that\nwe have right now the four or five\nbreaking news updates that we have as of\nthis minute armad party officially\nsaying that the government now will run\nfrom the prison armad party saying that\nthe government of Delhi will now run\nfrom prison if\nrequired anticipating the arrest of Arin\nkrial aadmi party saying that even if\nhe's arrested the government will\ncontinue to run from prison and we have\nsome movement there in the national\ncapital some movement outside kajal's\nhouse shaan some movement are those cars\ngoing in or out all right those were\ncars coming in earlier we are told those\nare cars coming in earlier with more\nofficers of the enforcement direct who\ncame to Arin kajal's residence a few\nminutes back in all likelihood Arin\nkrial from what we given to understand\nthe enforcement director wants to take\nhim wants to take him to the enforcement\ndirector office where senior officers\nare already present special director\nspecial director of the enforcement\ndirectorate is at the headquarters of Ed\nas we speak meeting has begun in the\nenforcement directorate headquarters\nsenior officers are part of the meeting\nin the headquarters seizures have been\nmade these are electronic seizures\nelectronic devices have been seized from\nthe residents of Arin krial these are\nsome details that we have and uh about\nthe electronic devices being seized the\nheadquarters of enforcement directorate\nhas been informed about the seizures\nmade we don't have the exact details\nArvin kial even at this minute\nchallenging the enforcement director\nwhich wanted to take him to the office\nkival insisting that he wants to be\nquestioned at his residence itself I'm\nnot sure he can have his way this time\naround he's had his way for nine times\nwhen they summoned him he did not\nrespond to the summons did not present\nhimself for questioning so technically\nthis is the first time that the\nenforcement directorate is questioning\nthe Delhi chief minister in the liquor\nscam in which they claimed that\nKickbacks of 100 CR Kickbacks of 100 CR\nwere given to Arin krial who he was a\nrecipient or the beneficiary of that\nKickback in the words of the enforcement\ndirectorate as claimed in court on a\nwritten piece of paper That's The Story\nSo Far a sitting chief minister whose\nparty says he's not a person but a\nthought he's not a person but a thought\nbut even that person as a citizen of\nIndia will have to face the law Arin\nkrial even as we speak is being\nquestioned he's being questioned inside\nhis residence 7 to eight officers uh\nentered initially with a search warrant\nfollowed by more officers who came in\ntwo additional cars they too are inside\nwe don't have the exact number of the\nnumber of officers inside but given to\nunderstand that anywhere anywhere\nbetween 15 uh at least 10 to 15 officers\ncould be present inside the residence of\nArin kajal the the senior officers two\nsenior officers are part of the\ninvestigation at Chief Minister's\nresidence a joint director rank officer\nis also at kajal's residence questioning\nis being done by the investigative\nofficer in the liquor scam case searches\nand questioning taking place\nsimultaneously and some devices have\nalso been seized these are El elic\ndevices perhaps which will be\ninvestigated further and the\nheadquarters of the enforcement\ndirectorate has been informed of the\nseizures that have been made I have\nDeepak also joining us from The News\nRoom in Delhi news room in Delhi and and\nI also have shaan joining me live from\noutside the residence of Arin krial\ngetting in an update from Deepak Deepak\nany more updates before I go across to\nshaan right uh right now I'm outside uh\nDelhi Chief Minister's residen here here\nas you can see around and I if I could\ntell my camera person to pan and show\nyou how the security has been ramped up\nhere completely there are police teams\ndeployed here and also an empty bus has\nalso been stationed here just to prevent\nany unted incident and if there is any\nbreakout of protest these protesters\nwill be detained and they will be taken\nover to the station in those buses and\nalso if you could see there's a lot of\npolice cover as well at the entrance of\ncivil lines leading up to the chief\nminister\nresidents and right now what we have\ngiven to understand is that 7 to8 uh\nofficers of the enforcement directorate\na second team has also reached uh the\nchief Minister's residence and as we\nspeak the questioning is currently\nunderway a senior investigating officer\nhas also reached inside and here as you\ncan see there is a double line of police\nbarricading here and also and uh just\nbehind us there's also a lot of slogan\nearing going on here as you can see this\nis clearly outside the chief Minister's\nresidence there's a lot of action\nhappening\nhere and there's a lot of slogan hearing\nalso going on and uh most of them are am\nadmi party supporters if I could uh tell\nour video journalist to show\nus\nwell here you can see the supporters are\nraising slogans in support of Arin krial\nand they are here saying that so far\nenforcement\ndirectorate\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nin\nin\n[Music]\nin this AIG charge coming in from uh the\namadm party supporters saying that every\ntime that the Prime Minister faces

to\n15 officers are present inside 7 to\neight officers landed up at his\nresidence a little after 6:30 p.m. more\nofficers joined them and they're all\ninside his house is a fortress you're\nlooking at the pictures of the\nsupporters of the amadm party at least\nat least about uh 50 to 100 m away from\nthe gates of Arin krial and that's a\ncrowd that's building up crowd that's\nbuilding up and uh I'm not sure they're\ngoing to remain there for a very very\nlong time given the given the\nindications that we're getting from\ninside the residence of Arin kial\nenforcement directorate is recording a\nstate M under Section 50 of the pmla act\nafter he is brought to Ed office so that\nis uh that is that is now almost a given\nthat they will record a\nstatement after he's brought to the Ed\noffice as well a statement is also being\nrecorded right now under Section 17 I'd\nlike to go across to shaan to get more\ndetails of the difference between the\nstatement that is recorded now and the\npossible statement that will be recorded\nwhen he taken to the Ed office the\nenforcement directorate in no move\nuh to let krial challenge them this time\naround he's being uh he's being question\nI have another breaking news update\ncoming in meeting at the enforcement\ndirectorate headquarters has now come to\nan end and that meeting went on for\nquite some time and it's now come to an\nend is what shaan is informing us shaan\nis also getting us the live breaking\nnews updates the minute-by-minute\nupdates first channel to get you the\npictures of the enforcement directorate\nteam at the residence of Arin kial the\nfirst Channel with the breaking news\nupdates of what's Happening inside both\nArvin kajal's residents and also at the\nenforcement directorate\nheadquarters so ladies and gentlemen\nthese are fast-paced developments let's\nkeep that audio on from Arwin kajal's\nresidence as well if you can pick up\npick up the ambience a bit you'll get a\nsense of what's going on there as arm\nadmi party workers have all landed up\nthere in the h\nshaan is back with us live shaan take us\nthrough each of these breaking updates\nthat you've just shared with\nus well in fact the latest DET let me\njust quickly take you through some more\nthat have just picked up from my sources\nuh one there is take you through some\nmore that I've just picked up from my\nsources uh one there is already a\nmeeting which is underway at the\nenforcement directorates headquarters in\nthe national capital that's where the\ndecision is going to be taken in a short\nwhile from now with regards to the\nfuture of City chief minister Arin krial\nwhat we can confirm that under Section\n17 of the pmla ACT Arvin K's statement\nhas been recorded by the enforcement\ndirectorate that as part of the searches\nthat were carried out I'm given to\nunderstand electronic devices were being\nseized and the big important development\nand a confirmation now coming in that he\nwas confronted with certain statements\nthat were recorded by the enforcement\ndirector in the last few months and\nthat's a a big development now coming in\nbecause remember that's a procedure and\nthat is usually done when the\nenforcement directed is actually seeking\nfor some sort of a cooperation if at all\nif at all Arvin krial does not really\ncooperate which essentially means if he\ndoes not respond to the questions that\nhave been asked by the enforcement\ndirectorate and they feel that he he's\nevasive about the question that have\nbeen asked there is a very very high\npossibility of a punitive action to be\ntaken if at all they are satisfied with\nsome of the responses that have come in\nthen after the searches that are\nbasically over the enforcement director\nwould hand over sumon to him asking him\nto come to the enforcement directorate's\nheadquarters now that appears uh to be\nthe secondary option at this point in\ntime because so far by way of sources\nwithin the Amad party as was pointing\nout a short while back it appears that\nthe arv Arvin krial wasn't really\nCooperative with the agency I just\nquickly take you through the\ndevelopments that are taking place right\nnow uh till about a short while back\nmost of the reporters were asked were\nallowed yes shaan shaan shaan I I shaan\nshaan shaan quickly shaan if you can\njust uh switch on your mic shaan I think\nwe have a poor audio there I'm not able\nto pick up the audio from your mic I'm\npicking up the audio of the ambience\nthat perhaps is the audio from the\ncamera if you can switch on your mic\nthen uh we can perhaps get a clearer\naudio of you I need a clearer audio of\nyou shaan just fix that mic and while\nshaan fixes that mic a quick breaking\nnews updates ladies and gentlemen there\nare five breaking news updates that we\nhave right now breaking news update\nnumber one and by the way arnab arnab is\ncoming up live in just a few seconds\nhe's just getting miked up in the\nstudios he's coming live on the debate\nin just a few seconds and just as Arab\nmics up and shaan fixes his mic there\nare five breaking news updates shaan\nbreaking news update number one\nstatement of Arin krial is being\nrecorded under Section 17 of pmla act\nthis is a statement that is being\nrecorded as we speak breaking news\nupdate number two the enforcement\ndirectorate has gone to the residence of\nArin krial with the evidence collected\nin the investigation over the last few\nmonths and perhaps over it it's been\nover a year now since the story broke\nout and they they're armed with evidence\nand they have the evidence in their\nhands inside the residence of Arin kajal\nbreaking news update number three Arin\nkial has been confronted with statements\nrecorded in the case he's been\nconfronted\nwith the statements recorded in the case\nshaan's audio has been fixed I want him\nto take us through the update shaan\nshaan Breaking News 4 and\n5 well four four whether four quick\nupdates that we have got one chief\nminister Arvin kajal's statement has\nbeen recorded under Section 17 read by\n1f which is basically when the searches\nare being carried out search is also\nbeen carried out under Section 17 of the\nP act just a quick clarification this is\nunder oath what is happening right now\nthe statement that is being recorded by\nthe enforcement directorate is under\noath the third important development\nseizures have already taken place in\nfact we are being told that an\nexplanation was sought from the chief\nminister with regard to certain seizure\nthat has been made which also includes\nelectronic devices that have been taken\ninto custody by the enforcement directed\nthe significant development that has\ntaken place is that the enforcement\ndirectorate has now taken along with\nthem certain statements that have were\nrecorded we do not know whose statements\nwere taken but there is a high\npossibility accused Samir mahendru\nwitnessed uh magunda Redi their\nstatements were extremely crucial and\nthe latest certainly being that of K\nKavita remember the enforcement\ndirectorate uh was you know put out an\nunprecedented statement saying that this\nwas an orchestrated deal between sitting\nchief minister Arin krial the then\ndeputy chief minister bis s sodia and\nBRS leader K Kavita and they called it\nan orchestrated deal between the three\nand this has happened just in the last\nfew days so there has been fast-paced\ndevelopments let me just also put this\non record that the meeting that is\nbasically underway right now in uh the\nnational in the headquarters in the\nnational capital that's where the\ndecision is going to be taken I'm\nexpecting that to be over in the next\ncouple of minutes in the next couple of\nminutes where the meeting is going to be\nover uh communication likely to take\ntake place with Senor officers who are\nthere but a quick check of what's really\nhappening a quick update now this we are\nbroadcasting from outside the chief\nMinister's residents uh scores of\npolicemen now being brought in the rapid\naction force has also been brought in as\nwe speak I'm told that the security has\nalso been tightened outside the\nEnforcement directorates office in the\nnational capital if at all a putative\naction is taken that's where the chief\nminister will be taken so the moment he\nis taken away from here that is a clear\nindication of the fact that the\nenforcement directorate has actually\ndecided to go ahead and place the chief\nminister under arrest and that decision\nwould be taken in a short while from now\nperhaps you know part of it has already\nbeen decided given the fact that this\naction that you're essentially seeing\nright now would only happen would only\nhappen after there are drones that are\nessentially being flown right now as you\nsee uh not very sure perhaps this would\nbe the Delhi police right now with the\nsecurity that you seeing the kind of\nsecurity that has been brought in uh\nthese drones I'll just stick with these\nimages coming in uh the drones that have\nbeen brought in so there is the\nsituation extremely fluid right now\nbackto back developments taking place\nI'll quickly take you through the top\nfive developments that are taking place\nat the top of nine as that big\ndevelopment taking place here behind me\nas the Searchers are underway over to\nedit Chief odob go\n[Music]\nSwami\n[Music]\nfrom the Delhi Studios of Republic TV\nit's time for Arab goswami on

evening and welcome viewers\nviewers I had predicted yesterday that\narind kajal's arrest is very likely you\nwill remember we debated it in detail\nand as I said it is moving exactly in\nthat direction now there are two ways of\nlooking at this one that after his\narrest arind krial supporters will start\na sympathy campaign for\nhim secondly that like heon sain or k\nKavita both of whom have been arrested\nin corruption charges it is unlikely\nthat arind krial will get any Mass\nsupport given two facts one that the\ncharges of liquor gate the corruption\ncharges against him are very serious\nchares of lior gate the corruption\ncharges against and\ntwo I've have got news that krial has\nbeen arrested ladies and gentlemen I'm\nbreaking that right now shaan is with me\nso I'm

move away from\nthe camera right now as you can see\nladies and gentlemen and arind krial has\nbeen questioned for at least a couple of\nhours but he's not been cooperating he\nhas made it absolutely clear he's in no\nmood to cooperate he refused to go to\nthe Enforcement directorate office he\ntold the joint director of the\nenforcement directorate that he will not\ncooperate he said that he will not move\nout he was set terms and\nconditionalities the joint director is\nthe same director ladies and gentlemen\nthe same director who has questioned and\narrested K Kavita earlier he was\nconfronted with statements he was\nconfronted with proof he was told by the\nenforcement directorate that they have\ncome with a sth of information that they\nneed to speak to him about it but Arin\nkrial is buying time and the whole\nstrategy of Arin krial and the aadmi\nparty is to have a whole group of people\noutside whole group of people outside\nyou know who can sort of you know do\nthis buildup let's get the am admi party\nspokesperson also like live right now\nladies and gentlemen way ahead of any\nother network way ahead way way ahead of\nany other network way ahead of any

enforcement\ndirectorate is a extortion Department of\nthe Baria J party it is not taken\nseriously by anybody except for those\nwho are blind bucks of the Bia Jan party\nso I understand that there are\nsympathizers of the Ed who think that\nArin krial should have just walked into\nthe Ed office gotten arrested on right\non day one but Arin krial is an honest\nleader who will get repreve from the\ncourts eventually and he has chosen the\ndifficult part arrested Your Leader has\nbeen\narrested sir your leader is under arrest\nnow can I complete my point you can\ncelebrate it AR I understand leader has\nbeen arrested should he not let I'm not\ncelebrating I'm saying that should he\nnot go on his own should he not go on\nhis own to the Ed office no he I'm not\ncelebrating I'm breaking a story should\nhe not go on his wants to go to the Ed\noffice he might as well go to the part\noffice because the party takes all the\nleaders against wh the Ed has notices\nand then the leader Jo

told that there is\na sense of you know there has been a\nbrief altercation between the chief\nminister and the enforcement director\nofficers pretty much what happened with\nChief Minister hean Surin too right now\nbecause it is going to be important that\nArvid krial signs that arrest memo the\nmoment the right please do this\ninv\nAR\nAR\ncour\nzaf Islam is joining the debate with AK\nmarati ladies and gentlemen I'm staying\nwith the shots throughout I'm staying\nwith the shots throughout the a lot of\nsecurity personel can I have the shots\non the air maximum time of the screen on\nthe shots ladies and gentlemen can I\nhave the shots on air constantly Aditi\nbecause the view viewers want to see the\nfullframe pictures right now that we\nhave from arind kajal's residents thank\nyou so much thank you we stay with the\npictures there what the am admi party\nhas been trying to do ladies and\ngentlemen what you're seeing on the\nground is that they're trying to get\nthousands and thousands and hundreds of\nworkers to the ground to start political\nprotests the challenge at this point of\ntime will be to take arind krial out\nfrom his residence and to the Ed\nheadquarters which is already being\ngiven maximum security So to avoid a\npolitical confrontation things have to\nmove very very fast uh these are\npressure tactics obviously the aadmi\nparty is a party mobilized in Delhi they\nwill do everything possible to stop\narind krial from being taken to create\nsome kind of Law and Order situation on\nthe ground out there we have the BJP\nfacing off with the op on the debate on\nboth sides of the screen s Zafar joining\nthe debate right now are you fearing a\nLaw and Order situation here right now\nwith AE marate on the screen and AE is\nthis very bad form nine summons you\ndodge 10 summons you've been given you\nrefuse to cooperate you tell the Ed you\nwill not cooperate you instruct them on\nwhat they should be doing this is after\nthe thrashing that you have got you've\ngot a thrashing in the high court the\nhigh court has pulled you up you lost\nyour case there and now you're trying to\nblock the\narrest you are trying to block an\narrested leader a marate from being\ntaken into custody a on the right can\nrespond can I can I respond now I think\nyou have been misinformed that we got a\nthrashing in the high court in the high\ncourt the court asked the enforcement\ndirectorate to show even one single\npiece of evidence that they have against\nMr Arin krial and the Ed was not able to\nshow even one your interpretation is\nHoly and completely incorrect in the\nhigh court today in the high court today\nyou went and asked them can I have you\non air on the right hand side\nand and and the other guests on the left\nthe debate is on now a marate today in\nthe cour today in the court let me\nfinish today in the court you said\nplease please issue instructions please\nissue instructions one minute I am\nspeaking over you because I'm countering\nyou can I just come in please okay and\nin the court today you went and said you\nwent and said can I have you on the\nscreen I can't see you on the screen so\nI can't take this debate forward Aditi\nthank you yeah so the question is is\ntoday in the court you went and said\nthat I should not be arrested and the\ncourt said I am giving you no such\nguarantee you demanded you said I should\nnot be arrested the court did not give\nyou any such guarantee did you ask for\nprotection from arrest and not get it am\nI right or wrong there can I finish my\npoint now the court said the court asked\nthe enforcement directorate are you\nplanning to arrest do you have any\nevidence against him the Ed said that we\nhave no evidence against him right now\nwe are not planning to\narrest speaking for so long that is what\ncan I just come in please the court then\nissued a show notice not asking them for\nexplanation the court asked the Ed for\nan explanation\nwhy the Ed was supposed to respond by\n22nd April I'm sorry you're completely\nmistaken and completely wrong I don't\nknow who's giving you a low down of the\nCourt you went to the court one minute\none minute one minute one minute one\nminute can you have three windows at the\nbottom today you went to the one second\none second one just one minute first\nishar is countering you on what happened\nin the court today I'm saying you lost\nthe case in the court you ref you could\nnot get protection you could not get\nprotection from coercive action in fact\nfor trying to set terms for an\nappearance and I said that yesterday as\nwell because there is epic\nmisinformation being spread your viewers\nshould know what happened in theable I\nboth yesterday and today can I make my\npoint if you could lower his Le because\nthis is absolute misin being spre not\noutright Li what happened in the on two\ndays first on the first the cour orally\nobserved why can you not appear on the\nsummons because you have received nine\nsummons now today there were two basic\nprayers before the court one the summons\nare illegal which the our party has been\nsaying outside the court the summons are\nillegal the Ed could not summon the\nsummons should be stayed the suon should\nbe qued the second aspect was on which\nthey were asking the court was relief a\nprotection from cores measures in simple\nlanguage a protection from arrest both\nthese requests neither the summons were\nstate that means the Ed had the right to\nsummon him nor was he given any\nprotection from arrest and the third\npart onto what Ed has a good case or not\nEd said during investigation we do not\nshow the case to any accused that's a\nstandard procedure by all investigative\nagencies but the court insisted that you\nshow us the courts the proof whatever\nfiles you have that was seen in the\nchamber after that was seen in the\nchamber The Honorable high court by an\nExpress order declined to give him any\nrelief declined to give him a relief of\nprevention\nabsolutely absolutely FAL that is a\nlegal how can you not know the law\nabsolutely false that is absolutely\nfalse let me let me respond now let me\nrespond that is absolutely false is\nabsolutely false you are lying you lying\non National Television why youed can I\nfor the last minutes without\ninterrupting him but you not let me\nspeak even\nfor before that I want to update viewers\nI want to everyone and I have zafur on\nthe left a marate on the right and zafur\nzafur I want to just recap the breaking\nnews right now Delhi chief minister Arin\nkrial has been arrested about five\nmobile phones have been seized by the Ed\nall the items have been taken into\ncustody the enforcement directorate\nreached his house after arind krial lost\nthe case earlier today where the Delhi\nHigh Court flatly refused any interim\nprotection from coercive action at this\nstage to arind krial arind krial had\nfiled an application seeking interim\nrelief in his plea challenging the Ed\nsummons and there was a division bench\ncomprising of Justice Suresh Kumar K and\nJustice Mano Jan uh they gave full\nLiberty to the enforcement directorate\nto file the response to kajal's\napplication and and the judge said that\nat this point of time we cannot give him\nany protection from arrest uh the Ed\nreached his house the Ed told him the\njoint director told him to come to the\noffice krial said I won't krial said I\nrefuse to move the Ed said he's not\ncooperating the deed has then arrested\nkrial krial is right now under arrest\nthe op says he run the government from\nlock up and we should be and the op has\nstarted mobilizing its workers outside\nthe house to create some kind of a\nphysical situation there that is the\nsequence of events now zafur Islam\nNational spokesperson of the BJP former\nRaj you heard the spokesperson\nyes\nsee I heard I heard the spokesperson I\nheard the various leaders of op speaking\nsame rhetoric which they are speaking\nfor last several days but this will not\nwork anymore because he has to pay for\nhis sins the sins he has committed\neveryone knows and there no authorities\nas all the evidences proving him that he\nis a guilty of committing crime along\nwith the many other people involved in\nliquor scam so he wants to take all the\nprotection from this from the legal\nprotection which he is attempting but\nthere is absolutely no relief from high\ncourt and he will not get any relief\nfrom even from supreme court because I'm\nsaying because of the crime he has\ncommitted no matter what the what the\nspokesperson say no matter what the\nleader of other spoke op leader says but\nthe fact is that that he has committed a\ncrime he has committed a sin and he is\npaying price for that sin now whether he\nappeals to Supreme Court nothing will\nhappen because he every the agencies\nhave proof and proof has been shown to\nthe high court and that's is why High\nCourt didn't give him any relief from\nthe arrest which he was thinking that he\nwill get protection from secondly what\nis more important Arab that op is trying\nto somehow create Law and Order\nsituation but let me tell you that no\nmatter whatever they try Law and Order\nsituation will be maintained as it has\nto be maintained and they they will not\nbe able to disrupt the Law and Order\nsituation in the state of Delhi because\nall the merary VES have been taken by\nthe security people by the authorities\nand these these people may try to\ndisrupt but we will not allow it to\nhappen that is more important Point rad\nthat third very important point that he\nwas thinking that he is above the law\nbut today it has been proven if you\ncommit a crime then law has its own way\nhow long am I supposed to listen to\neverybody\nelse that he has committed a\ncrime interruped by you to make a single\npoint throughout the show no you if you\nare interrupting me you'll have to face\nmy questioning I will certainly question\nyou but it cannot be a oneway street one\nminute one minute it cannot be a oneway\nstreet has\ncrime for just one minute viewers\nviewers this this impression this I I I\njust want to make one point out here\nthat it is very easy for aay marate or\npank Sharma or Akash deep monei or\nMahesh Bala all of whom are on air and\nMr Bala is spokesperson of the BRS to\ncome on air that this is wrong that is\nwrong Etc however I swear by every word\nof what I'm saying here tonight viewers\nand I know that you believe me I'll tell\nyou what has happened today viewers\nfirst DD summon 2nd November\n2023 Arin krial doesn't go second DED\nsummons 22nd December AR ref third sum\nJanuary refuses summons 18 January Arin\nK\nFebruary refuses six summons 19th\nFebruary Aral refuses 7th

people\non the screen pleasee you don't care for\nthe court you don't care for the law you\ndon't care for the facts you don't care\nfor the high court and the high court\nhas turn you down sellout you're a\nsellout of the BJP that's what you are\nyou can say what you want don't believe\nyou are a neutral person you can say\nwhat you want you you can say what you\nwant\nI\nrunning you are going to this way you\nburst an artery and achieve nothing one\nminute one minute one minute can I can I\nzaf zaf one minute zaf I can completely\nunderstand P I can completely understand\nAkash I can completely and totally\nunderstand I can completely I canting I\nI'm not celebrating I'm reporting it you\nare the one who's very hot under the\ncall to I completely understand because\nneed to know that your viewers need to\nknow that arav kwami is with the BJP and\nhe will celebrate Arin K being arrested\nbut what you will not tell them is 2\nmonths before the Loa election an\nopposition leader being arrested he's a\ndictatorship you you you should take\nresponsibility for dictatorship that\nthrown\nunder will give it nice and proper I\nwill give it back to you nice and proper\nbut but but one minute but one minute I\nrequest everyone tonight iqu no no no no\nno no no Z zaf Islam 1 minute one minute\none minute one minute one minute one\nminute Z Zafar Islam 1 minute\nAKA marate has taken it too far and he\nwill now have to listen to me if he is\nnot a coward he will have to listen to\nme if he is a coward he will interrupt\nme I have listened to him and I'm now\ngoing to give it back to him and unless\nhe's a coward he will listen to me now\nand I'm sure he's not a\ncoward today ladies and gentlemen fact\nis that the court refused to pass an\norder granting interim protection from\narrest to\nkrial and the court said and I quote we\nhave heard both the sides however at\nthis stage we are not inclined to pass\nany order exactly this is called a\ndefeat in the high court exactly and you\ncan cry scream call anyone a BJP\nspokesperson but it is a fact second\npoint the court\nemphasized the court emphasized it's not\nthe BJP the court so you be careful what\nyou say because jal's lawyer singi had\nsaid today that Ed has filed six charge\nsheets 25,000 documents what is the\npurpose of the summons then the court\nsaid Akay marate and you are probably\nunaware therefore uninitiated you are\nsaying things without knowing the court\nsaid and I quote the words of the Court\nunless arind krial appears please note\nviewers unless arind krial\nappears how will he know what\ninformation documents the Ed ultimately\nwants from\nhim so the court give an instruction\nAkash that Arin krial must appear yes\nyou will attack the court now yeah I\nwill attack the court let me let me\nreply a back uh just I just now he'll\nattack the court now he'll attack the\ncourt listen to me no no now he says I\nwill attack the he'll attack everybody\nto listen to No No he said I didn't say\nthe op spokesperson said I will attack\nthe court one minute Akash watch The\nWords the op National spokesperson said\nI will attack the court now so attack\nthe court I'll give you the fact sir\nattack the court sir I'll\ngive the op spokesperson AA marate just\nsaid yes I will attack the\ncourt no\nno to disagree with\nthe everyone have to respect\nthe but I have you said the court said\nnothing when IED the you saying I\ndisagree with it one minute I want to\nput some facts\nhere you I respect you so much but today\nyou put out the court proceeding\nselectively sir I substantiate my\nargument today the today The Honorable\nASG who is a lawyer of Ed said in the\ncourt that neither Ami party or ar krial\nis the accused in this matter of excise\nscam alleged excise scam even that went\nto the other level where the court asked\nenforcement directory to present\nmaterial evidence against Irvin kial to\nwhich enforcement direct said in the\ncourt that material has is been\ninvestigated so the material not\nsufficing so material has been\ninvestigated cannot be presented in\ncourt quote\nunquote so the evidence was not suffice\nto arrest or to produced in a court of\nlaw against Arin Kel as per the\nenforcement director's lawyer Mr Raju\nwho is the additional solicor General\nthird point that Delhi completely\ncompletely completely said something\ncompletely and\nincorrect can I come\nin\nenforcement to file that reply to Arin K\nwhat is the final judment\nby by the court did he did they give any\nthis is beyond\nmisinformation I'm not making people sit\npull the chairs and sit\nyourself now now no no while everybody\nparty will be attacking today we know\nthat in 2018 no no let me ask you one\nquestion let me ask him one question\nforget about the proceeding what is the\nfinal outcome what is the final outcome\ndid he get any protection from the court\ndid he get any protection from the court\ndid he get any from the court he didn't\nget any from the court that's why he has\nbeen\narrested the point is the point is akash\nakash akash akash let me see if Shan can\ngive me\ncan andar come into the studio like I\nasked them to come at 9:00 to can they\ncome in please on their own walk into\nthe studio please thank you very much\nand now and now I'm on the debate with\nI'm making a point here this is\ntremendously distracting and please sit\nup now I'm now I'm making a point here\nnow I'm making a point here uh just one\nminute please just one minute just one\nminute just one minute just one minute\njust one minute\nsee today the high court told arind\nkrial why don't you file an anticip bail\napplication in the court\nyet okay now the Ed in fact assured the\ncourt Akash deep I don't know to what\nextent you can lie but obviously you\nhave your own limits the court asked the\nEd tell us what evidence you have\nagainst him for arrest is there any\ndocument against krial in response to\nwhich the Ed told the court my Lord we\nhave the\ndocuments and ishkaran says that that in\nconfidence the investigating agency\nshared certain documents yes yes so the\ninvestigating agency shared certain\nmaterial in confidence with the material\nis being\ninv now you have I mean obviously you\nhave I\nmean to have the investigative agency\ndocuments they don't know the basic law\nof the\nland\nagency at stage of Investigation gives\ndocuments to anybody who under the\nscanner That's the Law land of\ncourse cover it is given to\njudges the basic law of the land I do\nnot know how much information they can\nspread on National\nTelevision this is notation this\nis gives orders does not\nis\nridiculous does not no I'm not getting\nthe audio\nclear I uh uh one minute uh P two years\nthis case has been going on for years\nMania has been in jail for more than one\nnot a single piece of has presented I\ncan't hear the audio be higher in the\nstudio I can't hear him a\nAE listen to\nme the court asked abishek Manu singi\nwho is kajal's legal representative you\nare a citizens over the country they are\ngiving you summons why don't you appear\nwhen you are given the summons what is\npreventing you from attending the\nsummons to which kajal said I'm not\navoiding I need protection from arrest\nbecause I am not a common Criminal I\nneed protection from arrest today the\ncourt says I am not going to give you\nprotection from arrest after which the\nEd went to question kajal and told him\nto cooperate he did not cooperate after\nnine summons he has been arrested I\nthink that as much drama as you may want\nto do the Delhi high court has rebuked\nkajal's lawyer for giving a flimsy\nexcuse of not knowing whether the\nsummons are sent for kajal as accused or\nwitness the court said pursuant to the\nsummons if you attend the call only then\nwill you get to know the Delhi high\ncourt has denied to entertain kajal's\nargument that summons are a trap to\narrest him please understand what atii\nsays in our press conference that there\nis no evidence is not the final word the\nEd respond you have to understand nobody\nyou see that Ed will not arrest a Delhi\nchief minister unless it feels it is\nsitting on sufficient\nevidence are you going to speak can I\nwhy aren you how long you have made\nstatements today which are Unworthy of\nyou and I I am compelled to respond to\nyou factually without descending to your\npersonal diet tribe I will not descend\nto you I resp I will not descend want to\nlisten to me to your level I am telling\nyou today

the\ndocuments has seen all the evidences and\nbased on that he didn't get Court didn't\ngive him any that something which is\nimportant for us to know what was\ndiscussed in the inside the court is\nsomething which is not relevant for us\nto discuss because we do not know\neverything what has happened there but\nwe know the consequences what happened\non the final outome so what happened to\na what was the consequence of what was\nthe\nconsequence\nconsequence he has committed consequence\nto has\ncommitted laay for his all his everybody\nwho's aligned with the BJP escapes jail\ntime and who has escaped the\nlaw esw the law he only going through\nthe law the law through the\nLA no law in this country\nhe going through the legal\nprocess BJP there is absolutely law for\neverywh you fa that there is no law for\nyou you Above the\nLaw is only\none of Delhi who is above the law sh has\nShan Shan cut to Shan Shan now please\nwith given to\nunderstand will arind krial step down\ngiven the fact that he has always taken\nthe position that any corruption\nallegation a person in public life will\nhave to step down are we looking at the\nchief minister of Delhi stepping down\nwith the arrest taken Arin krial was the\nchief minister of Delhi is the chief\nminister of Delhi and Will Remain the\nchief minister are you suggesting that\nthe government of Delhi would be running\nfrom the jail absolutely it will be\nrunning from thar jail because this is\nthe clear modest operandi of the bhartia\nJan party put allegations of corruption\nunder pmla on all opposition leaders\narrest them why do they file cases only\nunder pmla because that is the only act\nin this country under which it is\nvirtually impossible to get bail as a\nsenior leader Aisha you would agree that\nthere was no relief coming in from the\ncourt primer faai there was evidence\nagainst your other leaders the then\ndeputy chief minister how is it you\nsaying there is no evidence absolutely\nwhere is the proceeds of crime can the\nEd after 2 years say they have recovered\neven one rupe from any am admy party\nleader they can't where is the evidence\nwhere is the proceeds of crime they have\nnot been able to show any proceeds of\ncrime despite having hundreds of\nofficers investigate the case thousands\nof raids and the timing of the arrest\nmakes it very clear tell someone as a\nsenior as a senior leader as an IRS\nofficer himself Mr krial says that tell\nme whether am I a suspect or a witness\nis that even a logical explanation it's\na logical question because the fact of\nunder I'm asking only under the section\n50 under Section 17 of the pmla act it\nis the prerogative\nagenc question for you why is it all\nP opposition leaders that's that you\nshould ask the enforcement director yes\nabsolutely the second question why is it\nthat all against the opposition leaders\ndo not happen under the crpc ACT they do\nnot happen under the prevention of\ncorruption act the only one act in which\ncases get fired also because\nthere is a corruption Case by the\nCentral Bureau of Investigation\nprecisely because that is the only law\nin the country it was the law was put in\nplace to prevent terrorism to prevent\ntrading of Narcotics today but it's also\nmoney simp shaan can you ask her whether\nshe thinks vij is innocent can shaan\nhear\nme\nwell you hear me one of the fact is that\nright now Party\nleaders right now you know I\nunfortunately I know because she's\nalready stepped out because right now if\nif I can just show you what's really\nhappening on the other side is right now\nmost of the Amad Party leaders have come\non the road that's the current situation\nreason why if you're wondering why feed\ncoming in ad if it is coming we'll cut\nto it is it coming in right now one sec\nI was just told that samit patra's feed\nis also coming in we're seeing live BJP\nreactions coming in can we cut to that\nplease can we cut to it immediately\nplease thank you very much moving ahead\non the story thank you let's hear the\nreactions viewers idea the idea of\ncorruption the idea of minting money\nthrough a I would say through excise\npolicy I mean this is unheard of louder\na CM a CM who talks about\neducation\neduc\nladies and gentlemen mahes Bala is\nspokesperson ad please cut out uh Mahesh\nBala is spokesperson of the BRS Mr Bala\ntoday arind krial was confronted by some\nstatements we are told now we are also\ntold that the joint director of the\nenforcement directorate who went there\nto question and then arrest arind krial\nis the same officer I think capil Raj\nwho arrested K Kavita so is it possible\nthat your leader K Kavita has made\ncertain\nstatements about the role of Arin\nkrial because things have moov very fast\nafter kavita's arrest\nno I think this is not from the last\narrest of kav because this case is going\non Investigation is going on for the\nlast two years but we need to look at\nthe timing and how it is motivated it's\na it's the elections are coming in the\nnext month and probably in the month of\nApril and May but you know the arrest\ntook place of kav and Arin K G now why\nwhy they took the last two years even to\ninvestigate and arrest but and other\nthing we need to question is but is are\nthere any cases on the BJP leaders are\neven the NDA leaders it's only the Ed is\ninvestigating only the opposition's\nleaders see like the all this Ed pmla\ncases are filed and investigated and\narrested all the opposition's leaders\nonly that's what like the India hasala\nMr Bala all the all the all the all the\nas you are aware all the all the\nopposition leaders went together to the\nSupreme Court and says we are being\ncollectively targeted the Supreme Court\nsaid this has no basis and sent you back\nthe Supreme Court said these are\npolitical matters you can't bring them\nin the area of the Court they are not\nlegally tenable arguments so the Supreme\nCourt has already dismissed that you\nknow that argument of victimization now\nwe need to go by what the courts are\nsaying panage this I don't think this is\ngoing to lead to any Mass sympathy\ncampaign it already doesn't seem to me I\nmean the op was expecting that people\nwill be out on the streets protesting\nmorning day and night it doesn't seem to\nbe\nhappening see the of the matter is\nthat too much of anything could\ndestroy sorrow laughs excessive Jo weeps\nlet me tell you arrest of kajal is going\nto Boom rang politically very badly\non\nbuddi don't say thatal is not going to\nget any sympathy out of this he will for\nmany years and especially for a few last\nmonths the entire nation is debating the\nissue of selective treatment by the\ninvestigative agencies of Modi\ngovernment it is charitable attitude\ntowards the leaders of the ruling\ndispensation and its bullying approach\nbullying approach towards opposition\nleaders is the actual cause of concern\nwhy two sets of execution methodologies\nfor the similar laws people are asking\nthis\nand it has become so obvious in last 10\nyears of Modi regime that you ask any\ncommoner on the streets ask October\n2023 on 30th October\n2023 pank G on 30th October\n2023 uh the Court Supreme Court said we\nwill not give bail to Manish\nsodia and the am admi party was shocked\naadmi party before that and I want to go\nback to this abishek s zafur Islam and\nAK are on the debate cour also said\nthere is a money Trail the Supreme Court\nsaid there is a money Trail the Supreme\nCourt said that a money trail of not 1\nCR 2 CR 33 crores but\n338 crores has been tely established\nthat is not I do not understand after\nthat how any am admy party spokesperson\ncan come and say that the courts are\nwith us the law is with us in fact can\nthe Supreme Court had made the fact that\nthe money trail of 338 cres was\ntentatively established the basis for\ndenying the bail of the former deputy\nchief minister of Delhi Manish sodia\nit's as clear as that these are the\nwords of the court and they also said\nthe new yes so AE are these the words of\nthe court or not you just respond with\nsaying yes or no then you can say what\nyou want this what cour what the Supreme\nCourt said or\nnot is this no no no no no no no you\ncan't avoid the question anymore is this\nwhat the Supreme Court said no you can't\navoid the\nquestion no I asking you and don't do\ntum with me please I'm calling you up I\nwill not descend to your level please\nplease do not please do not I'm showing\nyou respect don't try to go too familiar\nwith me speaking to a senior journalist\nyou don't cross the line you let me\nspeak yeah but it doesn't matter man\nwhatever you say I'm still calling you\nI'm calling you out respectfully what do\nI do with your respect what do I do with\nI don't care what you do one minute one\nminute I don't care what you do I am\nasking you a question is that what the\ncourt said is that what the court said\nlet me speak you let me speak is that\nwhat the court said let me speak let me\nspeak is this what the court\nsaid the 338 money Trail did the Supreme\nCourt refer to the 338 money or not they\nenough is enough I enough is\ndid the Supreme Court mention so he say\nhe can't answer the question that is\nprecisely the problem out here the\nsimple question being if you are asked\nwas there a 338 CR money Trail you don't\nwant to answer the question but Akash\nthere's no running away from that this\nis the fundamental question you'll be\nasked in the courts of public opinion\nalso see no no one minute let Akash take\nthat yeah yeah I'll answer the question\nyou are right that The Honorable Court\nsaid that whatever the profits made in\nthis policy that will be considered as\nproceeds of crime that is that CES to\n331 CR I acknowledge that but the\nprofits made by it was by the companies\nnot by the there was no money Trail to\nManish isia San Singh or even arind kaj\ntill now there is otherwise Ed would\nhaveed with the tax of money now Z Islam\nplease don't Heckle please don't Heckle\nplease let me speak sir please now now\none of the most important factor I want\nto tell today is that normally today\nwhile all of us are talking about krial\nbeing arrested sanj s who was named as\nterrorist by up police in 2018 joined BH\nJ party so terrorist join\nall I'm trying to tell you that no no\nall I'm trying to tell you that you how\ncome you are giving him a certificate\nhow come you are giving him a\ncertificate when court has given the\ncertificate how how can you give the\ncertificate what has enough evidence\nagencies have enough evidence against M\nTR there enough evidence against him all\nthe proceeds of the crime has gone to he\nis the\nbenici not the only benici the deputy\nchief minister is also the\nbeneficiary to that\nseparately at all we to discuss about\ndiscuss separately right now we\ndiscussing\nabout\nno accept accepted Pro PR through and\npractice unfair practices are not tell\nme why no no no I'm asking you about K\nwhy are you trying to digress I'm not\ntrying to dig we will have a debate\nseparately we discuss everything about\nit but why are you trying to dig\nI'm asking a direct question did he get\ndid he get any relief from the court no\ndid he get any relief from the court or\nnot no he didn't get any Rel why because\nthere evidence against him you must\nunderstand would have given him\ndefinitely some relief and he would have\nbeen given protection from the arrest\nsince he didn't get the protection\ndefinitely mean meaning that there is\nenough evidence against him like there\nis enough evidence\nagainst\nthe way the case is likely to go the way\nthe case is likely to go one minute one\nminute the way the case is likely to go\nviewers people are asking what will\nhappen next abishek you see now that it\nis a question of a sitting chief\nminister who has been\narrested I don't think the agencies can\nafford to take chief minister is\narrested resigned H San resigned in his\ncase he's a chief minister technically\nwho is arrested then the court therefore\nhas to the agency has to prove that\nkrial has violated the prevention of\nmoney laundering act so obviously they\nwould have had to force a Money Trade\nsee it's not the CBI which is arrested\nhim are you sure here that the AG CBI\ncase also there's a CBI case but the Ed\nhas chosen to arrest him which means\nthat it's an act of finality by the EDI\nso they cannot take a risk of arresting\nsitting chief minister without and\nfacing the embarrassment yes without in\nthe court of being pulled up by the\ncourt saying that you do not have\nreasons to arrest him yes so would they\ntake that risk they would not I mean and\nlook at the kind of a stance Supreme\nCourt has taken over the last couple of\nweeks or they've been very tough and uh\nthere is no Indulgence whatsoever with\nwhatever position the government takes\nso obviously agencies like the\nenforcement directorate and CBI which\nare\nuh under attack from the position they\nwould not take any chance whatsoever in\nso far as documents evidence and coll of\ndata is concerned corre correct so I I\nbelieve and all those people who are\nattacking these agencies on the panel\nalso would understand that when\neverything is happening under such a\nglare lens of media and Court scrutiny\nthe agencies would be very cautious and\nconscious of the fact that their work is\nunder great scrutiny and today they\nshared their work with the honorable\nJudge today the Ed showed every document\nthey have all proofs they have mail TR\nmoney tril everything to the to the to\nthe high court judge and then let the\njudge to decide whether you want to give\nprotection or not the judge did not give\nprotection why are you\nnot so so fundamentally I think I'll\ntake a break at this point viewers uh\nwhen I come back I'm going to go live\nbecause arind krial has been arrested\nbut my last information is on the ground\nthat he has not been physically taken to\nhis residence yet now how do I look at\nit viewers the liquor gate scam is under\ninvestigation these are pictures here\nlet's hear the Ambient\nsound okay these\nare I'm not getting audio here in\nthe okay so so so so ladies and\ngentlemen Manish Soria who is one of the\naccused in the Delhi lakor gate scam\ncase former deputy chief minister of of\nDelhi he has also got multiple criminal\ncharges slapped on him by the CBI what\nI'm trying to say is this is not just a\npmla case this is not just a Ed Case\nthis is also a criminal case under\ninvestigation under IPC section 20b so\nthere are serious charges out here uh\nthere is no doubt that there was a\nliquor Scamp the only difficulty for the\nagencies will be that arind krial so far\nas I know has not had signing Authority\non any of these cases so you know the\npeople who've been signing off on the\nfiles have been Manisha sodia and others\nhowever is there something else which\ncan be established which corroborates\nhis role viewers krial arrested I'm back\nin a few\n[Music]\nminutes\n[Music]\nstart\nstartup tax\nspace\nagriculture textile medicine transport\nspace\n[Applause]\nstart\nS\nspace\nman\nalready\n[Applause]\nspace\nstartup\necosystem\nfrom the Delhi Studios of Republic TV\nit's time for the\n[Music]\ndebate\n[Music]\narnab goswami on the debate at 10\npowered by RAR University quick heel\nsaite policy Bazar co-powered by\n99acres.com dark editions by Tata\nMotors welcome back ladies and gentlemen\nto the debate and now it's time for the\nnation's sharpest opinion the big story\ntoday is that arind krial has been\narrested now I followed arind kajal's\ncareer extrem ly closely for the longest\nperiod of time in fact at some point of\ntime people said that I was responsible\nfor providing sort of media support for\nthe am admi party's predecessor which\nwas India against corruption and I\nalways held the view that we were not\nsupporting an individual we were at that\npoint of time supporting a cause viewers\nI clearly remember at that time arind\nkrial came into my Studios and promised\nto me that he would never join politics\nso Arin krial is known to change his\nposition and nobody knows that more than\nthan me however today he's in a\nvulnerable position what is my reading\nof the situation what I would like to\ntell you on the nation's sharpest\nopinion this evening dear viewers and if\nyou look at the situation very very\nlogically is that it's absolutely an\nallout case now either arind krial gets\nfully exonerated in which case it's\ngoing to be supremely embarrassing for\nthe BJP or arind krial gets convicted in\nwhich case it is going to be the very\nend end of his political career there is\nno Halfway House in cases like this and\ntherefore Arin krial knows that the BJP\nknows that the central government knows\nthat now if arvind krial after being\narrested gets the support of the courts\nthe courts say there is no case is\nno it'll be a body blow for the central\ngovernment before the general election\nand I think knowing all of these\nvariables there would have been some\nvery cool political calculation done by\nthe central government that if it is\ngoing in for the arrest of arind krial\nit better have enough information to\nback up and build a case against him now\non the other side Arin kajal's entire\npolitical career has been built not on\nthe freebies which he started giving\nwhen he was chief minister it has been\nbuilt fundamentally on his initial\npositioning as an anti-corruption\nCrusader whether he was in reality one\nor not we can't argue about it some\npeople say it's arguable but the fact is\nthat when he started his political\ncareer he was seen to be one of the\nfollowers of anah hazare and it was the\nanti-corruption campaign a lot viewers a\nlot has changed since the spring of 2011\nand the spring of\n2024 in these 13 years Arin krial has\nbecome an absolutely hardened\npolitician Arin krial knows that it's\nall out arind krial has made fundamental\nmistakes he has used taxpayers money to\nbuild himself an extremely expensive\nhome and things things like that which\nare not good for public perception but\nhe's also been extremely careful on no\ndocument or government policy has he\never taken his own signature which means\nhe has always tried to look at the\nlong-term political career that he has\nahead of him and uh try and wait what\nworks for him what does not work for him\nand try and if required put the blame on\nhis colleagues whether it be Manish\nSoria whether it be satender Jen but\nmade sure that none of that taint ever\ncomes back to him so viewers also\ntonight another point to make is that\nthe congress party is in a spot because\nthis is the very Congress that had said\nthat the entire krial government the\nentire krial cabinet is immersed in\ncorruption and when did they say that\nthey said that in 2023 and as an icing\non the cake the congress party said the\nchief minister should be arrested for\ncorruption I would like to remind the\nviewers tonight that it'll be very\ndifficult for the congress party to do\nwhat it has to do after this because the\ncongress party had said that because of\nliquor gate arind krial is drenched in\ncorruption and arind krial should be\narrested in liquor gate this was still a\nfew months back 2023 Arin krial\npretended to be the beacon of the\nanti-vip racism he was against the lbti\nbut ladies and gentlemen this is the\nsame krial is doing in his own source\nviewers therefore some people would say\nit is time for the mask of morality or\nrather immorality of arind krial to come\noff it is time for for the people to see\nhis real face out here the very people\nwho believed in his story of being the\narm admy with having the strong values\nof the middle class will now Define his\nfuture so viewers these are some very\nyou know clear questions that emerge out\nof the situation tonight let me go first\nto shaan to get a sense of what's\nhappening shaan it's been a long time\nit's been a long time how many people\nhave turned up outside kajal's house and\nwhy is he not being taken out\nyet and what's what's going to happen\nnow that he's been\narrested\nwell well in fact the arrest memo has\nalready been served in fact the grounds\nof arrest has already been read out to\nthe Chief Minister the reason for the\ndelay that we are seeing right now is\nbecause of a Law and Order situation uh\nthat is basically developing outside the\nchief Minister's residence I'll just\nquickly show you uh these are the images\nof senior aadmi party leaders who are\nout on the road right now you have aishi\nhere and several of the other am ADI\nParty leaders now this as you can see\nright now know this entire area has been\ncompletely blocked because a short while\nback you've had senior Amad Party\nleaders uh blocking this road not\nallowing any movement to take place so\nyou have had the rapid action force that\nhas been brought in on both sides so on\nthe other side it's on the other side is\nwhere the chief Minister's residence is\nthat area has been completely uh\nbarricaded we're expecting that to\nhappen in a short while from now\nmeanwhile there has been an additional\ndeployment that has been brought in uh\nthat that at the enforcement director's\noffice so in a short while from now it's\nexpected that he'll be taken out that's\nwhere a medical examination will also\ntake place but yes there is a Law and\nOrder situation building outside the\nchief Minister's\nresidence okay shaan is there abish know\nyou mentioned about the fact that krial\ncut his teeth into politics with with\nanti vvip movement but look at what's\nhappening really almost 5 to 7 kmet jams\nis what we are getting to understand\nshaan was just mentioning about the law\nand ughter situation people are coming\nout blocking roads and obviously this is\nbeing mobilized and orchestrated so this\nis not following the letter and spirit\nof the law this is trying to Hoodwink\nmanipulate Etc in terms of when you're\nfacing the law also also the fact that\nyou were mentioning about arind krial\nnot signing any document now there is\nthis section in IPC now the BNS would\nhave a different number uh in the\nbhartia n s\nuh section 33 read along with section\n120b of the IPC which is conspiracy\ntaken together with common intention and\ncommon objective then you don't need a\nsignature because if you're part of a\nconspiracy there is common intent if\nsomething is proved for one it proves\nfor everyone involved in the conspiracy\nright so I think so I think that that\nbit that bit of homework obviously the\nagencies would have done so the whole\nattempt here awara has been to try and\nproject arind krial as the ring master\nwhat they call loely the Kingpin Kingpin\nthe Kingpin of the scam uh the amadm\nparty says that you you this is a\npositioning you've created but you don't\nhave concrete evidence against krial yet\nwhat's the inner thinking in government\ncircles within the Ed within the BJP\nthat you're hearing no it's very clear\nas far as BJP is concerned BJP says let\nthe agencies decide and today the\nagencies because the allegation which\nthe Amad party levels onto the agency\nthat they work on the behalf of the\ngovernment that is the BJP so today the\nagency gave gave all the documents all\nthe proofs they had to the judge and\nallowed what do you mean all the proof I\nmean they presented the complete file\nagainst krial and not only krial the\nwhole mail Trail the whole line of\nconnection between Samir mahindru vij\nall the people who are involved in this\nLakers scam and confidential information\nwas shared the court with with the Delhi\nhigh court judge today and then he was\ntold sir there is only one request\nplease don't share it with anyone else\nand now you decide should protection\nbeen given should protection be given\ndon't forget there are approvers or not\nthere are\napprovers we are still not questioning\nthe BRS leader said no there is no\nconnection the day after K kav was was\narrested ARA for the first time krial\nwas made a co-conspirator with an amount\nof 100 CR being mentioned by\nEd true so uh I'd like to go across to\nsidhart who's on the debate right now\nsidhart Sharma of the am admi party and\npratus Kant of the BJP is with us uh we\nhave with us subra I see her on the\nscreen U now a point being made here\nsadhart I can see I I appreciate the\nfact that you are smiling you have a\nsmiling face tonight your other\ncolleague was so angry almost exploded\non the show aay marate but you are a man\nwith more experience uh however the the\nthe the specific point tonight it's it's\nfutile to ask you for your reaction\nbecause I know what your reaction will\nbe the specific point we are coming to\ntonight with you sidhart is that uh the\ncourt was given a\nfile and pratus please pay attention to\nthis the the government was very keen to\nwin the\ncase to make sure that Arin krial does\nnot get any protection from\narrest so the government went all out\nand through additional solicitor general\nSV\nRaju it placed time told a full\nconfidential envelope and file before\nthe honorable Judge and said milords\nhere is the information on the basis of\nwhich we have to interrogate him take\naction against him him being arind krial\nbut the court was also requested by the\nagency that this is highly confidential\nand very explosive information regarding\nMr\nkrial and I am sharing this with you in\nconfidence and please\ndo not stop us from arresting him if\nnecessary The Honorable High Court saw\nthe file\nsadhar and after seeing the file said\nyou have to cooperate and I'm not going\nto give you any protection from\narrest so obviously there is some\ninformation which has been shared with\nthe\ncourts some very sensitive\nfacts some astonishing details perhaps\nhave been shared by the courts with the\ncourts so sidat this is going through\nlegal\nprocess yeah it's not offici anymore\nit's a very straightforward accurate\nlegal process\nyes uh let me at the very outset tell\nyou that uh\nuh hundreds of nearly 100 years ago we\nalso saw that when ped with a Bradman\nthe England cricket team led by Douglas\nJardine resorted to Bodyline bowling now\nit was for the people to judge whether\nthat was right or wrong that was that\nwas one of the reasons why I was smiling\nthis is in politics as in sports uh you\nyou compete you compete everything\nbecomes fair in war and politics anyway\nI'll come to the very specific points\nthe legal jargon that you were speaking\nto and I think the viewers of Republic\nTV also have a right to know what\nhappened today in the courts I'll be\nvery succinct it'll be very crisp hardly\n10 sentences within 10 sentences I end\ntoday what happen happened was arind\nkrial challenged Ed notices to him the\ncourt gave Ed April 22nd to respond uh\nif if earlier as you said the the the\ncourt was apprised of some sensitive\ninformation the court would have said\nasked Arin krial to get arrested forth\nwith or or cooperate with the Ed forth\nwith it did not do so it the court gave\nEd 22nd April to respond the Ed had\nearlier in its own press release has\nnamed arind grial as the top leader of\nAmad party but paradoxically in court\ntoday the Ed said that it was it has\nneither named him named him as an\naccused nor wants to question him as an\nAmad party leader now going further the\nEd also said that it can arrest anybody\nanytime but it had not done so till that\ntime now what these things make clear it\nis now clear that there is no no money\nTrail found either with arind krial as a\nperson or as an accused now Ed had two\noptions today after that either respect\nlaw and convince the court on April 22nd\nthat Arin krial was some kind of\nbeneficiary or the Ed had an option to\nrespect the BJP and arrest a\nconstitutional figure who was neither an\naccused nor a beneficiary in Ed's own\nadmission now this was a catch 22\nsituation for for BJP it had to arrest\narind krial knowing fully well that it\nis doing so at its own Peril and\nconfessing to its Panic that it does not\nhave answer to Arin k 's model of\ngovernance it is as simple as that every\neven a lay man today knows that sub\njudice matters can't be acted upon still\nBJP going ahead means BJP is so spooked\nby amadm party that it can go from\nillegal to blatant acts to stop arind\nkrial it is now crystal clear that after\ngetting caught pants down today\nincidentally what had happened today was\nat 5:00 the election commission had also\nput on on its website the 8,250 CR Al\nmoney that BJP had so BJP had go his\nillegal funds that publication\ndesperately BJP needed a headline change\nand I think that is what they are trying\nto do now as far as aadmi party is\nconcerned arind krial is a model of\ngovernance that model of governance got\nacceptance not just in Delhi but Punjab\nalso I think that you are one minute uh\nuh uh one minute uh can I can I can I\ncan I stop you right there sir\nabsolutely see what\nhappens what happens what happens is\nthat I I think that we must remain keep\nour\nfocus and my focus is on the legal case\nthat has to be there or not there\nagainst Mr kajal before that once let me\ngo across to Deepak shaan is there of\ncourse Deepak if you can hear me what's\nyour location what's happening around\nyou right now what are you hearing about\nwhen Mr krial may be brought out and why\nis it taking so much\ntime right I'm currently outside uh the\nEd headquarters and behind me if I could\nask my uh video journalist to pan and\nshow you these are the barricades that\nhave been set up outside the Ed\nheadquarters heavy security deployment\nhas also been put in place at the Ed\noffice and Beyond these barricades\nthat's where Arin kial will be taken and\nfurther questioning will be done and\nwhat we are also getting to understand\nhere is that four companies of\nparamilitary force as well as 100 police\nDelhi police force have been deployed\nacross uh the national capital all the\nroads leading from the Delhi Chief\nMinister's residence till the Ed office\nuh the entire route has been jam-packed\nand uh the police deployment is also\nhigh in the roads leading up to the Ed\nheadquarters so what we are given to\nunderstand is that shortly Arin kial\nwill be brought to the Ed headquarters\nwhere rml Health officials will carry\nout his medical examination similar\nsituation as to what happened with\nSanjay Singh and satendra Jane as well\nso similar process will be followed\nfirst Arin kial will be brought to uh\nthe Ed headquarters after which a\nmedical examination will happen rml\nHealth officials will also reach the Ed\nheadquarters

at the\nenforcement directorates headquarters\nright here and inew of uh thank you\nthank you Deepak thank you thank you\nDeepak Deepak the the there is a there\nis another question here\nnow pratus the am admi party says arind\nkrial will be chief minister from thar\njail or from custody is this tenable is\nthis possible can you have the chief\nminister of Delhi run his office from\njail I mean there has to be some\nreasonableness to suggestions now pratus\nwhat's your take on\nthat well whatever krial does doesn't\nshock me his thought process Arab I\nreally watched this man's career very\nclosely and I'm so surprised that today\nwhen he's going to jail I was just\nremembering that his politics is based\non lies sitting in Delhi he's trying to\nrun Punjab basically he was a Kingpin to\ncorruption everywhere either you look at\nWater\nBly infrastructure projects there was\nnot a single place where he and his\npeople didn't want to make money\nincluding the Shish M which he made\nwhere he lives even there the\ncontractors given money I mean there a\nwhole Saga of scams which this man was\nheading all through and today when he\ngoes to jail and I was listening to the\nop uh spokesperson and I realized that\nhe missed a point spes the arm admy\nparty went to the lower court where they\nsaw the paper they didn't listen to him\nthey went to high court they went to\ndouble bench they went to the epex court\nthe single judge said there a clear\ntrail of 300 please don't disturb my\ntime go to the lower court and come to\nus again even tomorrow he'll get\narrested he'll go to Supreme Court\nSupreme Court will never listen to them\nthey will say please follow the due\nprocedure which is laid down in this\ncountry that you go to the right\nappropriate bench and then you come to\nus krial was trying to ask the Ed you\nsend me the questionnaire do it on video\nchat tomorrow you will ask the judges\nyour lordship you please give judgment\nand tell me why you have given this\njudgment do we have this in our\nconstitution is this man above\nConstitution he was trying to run away\nfrom all these summons because he knew\nthat all the roads were leading to his\nhouse and event finally today the people\nof Delhi will be relieved that this\ncorrupt man is going to jail and it was\nhigh time had to be fixed because has\nreally suff 10 years PR Prat we have a\ndeveloping story we have a developing\nstory uh awara wants to come on it the\nDelhi LG is to sub report submit a\nreport to the to the m absolutely is a\nhuge issue about whether you can be\nchief minister uh from prison no the law\nwhat's the latest on that absolutely at\nthis point of time keeping in mind that\nthere is a special status of Delhi\nkeeping in mind the law in place what we\nare being told by our sources that a\nchief minister cannot be in prison and\nrun the government this will hamper the\nprocess and in that case no there a\ntechnicality there there's a jail man no\nthere jail man there is a jail manual or\nthe so the jail manual Clearly say two\nplease yeah thank you yeah jail manual\nclearly says that there is no provision\nunder which uh Minister can work from\ninside the jail a minister cannot a\nchief minister also a minister so the\nthe jail the jail manual in in case of\nthar jail I'm being told is very clear\nthat isar jail specific or all jail I'm\ngetting to know\nfrom the m has already sources are\nclearly telling me m has gotten active m\nis saying either he has to be replaced\nor removed so it is up to the amadm\nparty because right now there is a whole\nbravado of the amadm party saying aishi\ncomes out s badw comes out you'll have\nthe amadm party spokesperson ha also\ncomes out and say that no he will run\nthe government from no he cannot the law\ndoesn't allow that and in that case if\nthe arm admy party sticks to it then\neither he has to be suspended a new\nchief minister has to be swanned in or\nthe process will follow tomorrow morning\nbecause till now the official as Shan\nwas just saying the arrest memo is being\nworked on the letter is still not out so\nthe L will be submitting the report\nwhile you speaking on on just live\nmovement there the Ed vehicles have just\ngone in inside the vehicles and they\nwill be bringing out everything if I can\nget the shot there or where the

the\nrule says that if the rule says sidat\ncan you hear me if the ru that you\ncannot be chief minister from jail you\ncannot create new rules for\nyourself yeah two things one is that\nDelhi will not be Delhi does not get\nadministered through a thar jail manual\nPoint number two in this same India the\nstalwart like atal bihari wajp had\nreminded of a Raja to\nbut he did he he chose not to accept it\nso right nowmy party is a political\nparty we have won with a people's\nmandate we have asked the people of\nDelhi that arind krial gets arrested\nwhat should be done can 95% of the\npeople have overwhelmingly said that we\nhave elected arind krial to serve us he\ncan serve us from wherever he wants to\nit's as simple as that he can serve us\nfrom wherever he wants to\nI need I need Shan to be there you need\nto understand Arin krial is not over and\nabove the law you may feel so but if no\nminister no arind krial no other\nminister irrespective of party amadm\nparty Congress BJP SP and the man who\ncomes out to defend you today is none\nother but Rahul Gandhi Rahul Rahul\nGandhi is coming out you need to\nunderstand does all cannot you cannot\ndoes not allow that you cannot\nsuperimpose ail manual on the of show me\nthe constitution of India and say that a\nchief minister cannot shall be running\nthe chief ministership from XY or Z\nplace can you show me the constitution\nof India saying so if not let's\nunderstand that the law according to you\nis not will not be administered\naccording\ntoh will be administered according to\nthe Constitution of India and if the\nconstitution of India I can explain sir\nunder the constitution of India there is\na vision of delegated legislation once\nParliament makes a law and\ndelegates oh okay fine under the\nconstitution of India there is a\nprovision of delegated legislation the\nJade Manuel comes under what is called a\ndelegated legislation and hands it\nintegral to the constitution of India\nand so the chief minister if he's inside\nthe jail has to follow the jail manual\nmy my my my question Here Right Now to S\nwill be and Sid I can understand the\nemotional tenor of what you're saying\ncan I have him on the shot and not be on\nthe eight window adii thank you I asking\nI am asking something to sidat Aditi\nthank you so much just one minute s just\nchill okay chill now s listen to me\nabsolutely it's a is is Manish sodia\ndeputy chief minister of Delhi today he\nis in\njail he's in jail for is he a present\ndeputy chief minister or former deputy\nchief\nminister well if you go back to the\ntimeline you will see that Mr man I\ncan't hear him loud enough in the studio\nfall back\nplease yeah uh I think if you go back to\nthe timeline why was he removed as\ndeputy chief minister why was he removed\nby arind krial as deputy chief minister\nafter he went to\njail two\nWHYY chief\nminister why not operate as deputy chief\nminister from jail you're asking me to\ndefend I've heard your question I'm\nasking you to answer my\nquestion yeah but as a defense you have\nto give me time to answer if you go back\nto the timeline and see Mr Manish zodia\nwas neither removed from the deputy\nchief ministership immediately after his\narrest after a considerable period of\ntime being the deputy chief minister he\nhimself said that he would have he would\nresign and that is why that action was\ntaken please go back to the timeline and\nsee immediately after his arrest he was\nnot removed as the deputy chief\nafter a considerable amount of time\nperiod of time had elapsed Mr Manish\nsodia himself said that he would like to\nresign then that is why it was accepted\nit is as simple as that go back to the\ntimeline and see\nnow just just just just just just one\npoint sir uh I would like to remind you\nthat the Manisha sodia was deputy chief\nminister of Delhi he was arrested and\nthe post of deputy chief minister has\nbeen wakened since the 1st March of last\nyear however the post of Chief Minister\ncannot be kept\nvacant it is not vacant as of today AR\nK Minister may not have a deputy chief\nminister but Delhi has a chief minister\nit is as simple as that you can't break\nthe rules for that you can't break the\nrules for\nthatal provision want secretar\noffic you want the secretar to operate\nthere if it is not there it was not\nthere for Mr NRA Modi in 2002 when Mr\nAtari vaj reminded him of rajad Dharma\nso what does not apply what is good for\nthe goose is good for the gander how\ncome it how come you there is some other\nrule for BJP and other rule for Amad\nparty Point number never arrested out of\nyour mind Mr Narendra was never arrested\nthere is no point number two you I\nwas never arrested there is no\ncomparison he was not arrested when was\nMr Modi arrested how can you draw\ncomparison to that wasn't he asked by\nthe prime minister of India Mr atel\nbihari vajpai to follow rajad\nDharma was he arrested what was he\narrested isn't it isn't it isn't it\nright that Mr Narendra Modi was under\narrested that argument no no no I mean\nyou have to you have to be reasonable at\nsome point of time you can't say\nanything and get away with it\nyou you can you can read a nursery L\nwith a lot of force it doesn't make your\npoint\nright incar not emerging subject of\ndebate can I go back to shaan please\nshaan is reporting live shaan what's\nhappening around you\nshaan I go I go straight to shaan I\ndon't have to go to the 11 window\nshaan well in fact this is the last\npoint from where we can report right now\nbecause the rapid action force has been\ndeployed here all the barric that has\nbeen done in a short while from now we\nexpect it from the other gate I'll just\nI'll just try and explain this to\nyou from where we are reporting right\nnow that's the chief minister this is\nthe chief Minister's residence which\nhave been as you can see right now\ncompletely locked that's the last point\nthe enforcement director team is right\ninside he will be taken out from this is\nthe gate right now there are a number of\narmadi Party workers who have all been\ngathered here and what you see right now\non my right hand side is the rapid\nthat has been brought in because there\nis a bit of a Law and Order situation\nthat developed a short while back with\nthe roads on the other side from where I\nwas reporting a short while back that\nwas completely blocked that's the reason\nwhy there has been a considerable delay\nright now in terms of the arrest\nformalities that have been that has\nalready been completed I'm given to\nunderstand in a short while from now uh\nthe enforcement director headquarters\nwhere the security has been broughten\nthe arrangements have already been\ndone\nalready done okay shaan I think we\ngetting a lot of video glitches on that\nuh pratus uh the op is very very adamant\nthat arind krial will remain chief\nminister and operate as chief minister\nfrom thar jail or wherever he\nis right and they they would like to\nmake a political issue of\nit they have all been trained by arind\nkri never believe a word of what they\nsay they will say something in the\nmorning by afternoon they will have a\npress confidence and totally Deni and by\nnight they will change the whole story\nthere is no element of Truth in whatever\nthey say the rule of the law of the\ncountry will prevail nobody can run this\ncity of Delhi from jail this man has to\nresign this man will not get bail\nbecause the law is so clear the evidence\nis there look at all those excise scam\nuh offenders they have been in jail for\nages because the proof is so strong the\nevidence is so\nstrong B money and you turn him into an\nappr and he\nnow isn't it true isn't it true for the\nBJP\nspokes you were talking absolutely\nnonsense but still I had the patience to\nyou please have patience to hear okay\njust have patience just have\npatience I I never interfered in what\nyou were saying you were talking\nabsolutely\nnonou\nlouder crime is Absol I was trying to\nmake a point here which this man is to\ndisturb me because he has no other story\nto tell the question is the evidence is\nso strong against so\nstrong see it took time for it took time\nfor him to get arrested because\n[Music]\ngovernance deficit it is as simple as\nthat there is absolutely no recy of\nmoney here neither neither neither 100\nthere is not a single P recovery still\nyou are arresting people you arresting\nconstitutional authorities how come\nthat's on the basis of a person becoming\nan appr and that appr\nto and this is this is only one case the\ninnumerable scams where investigations\nare going on eventually all of them are\ngoing to mature and this man for all the\ncorruption he has done in\nlikei were arrested they were put behind\nbars they were under the maintenance of\ninternal Security Act for nearly 17\nmonths in jail they did that stop it is\nBJP saying that mrhar\nand\nMr National threat no were national\nheroes we are also saying Heroes so what\nyou do with there is a weapon how do do\nyou use that weapon you have a nice I\nthink now it is a polarized fight\nbetween bjp's ideology\nand can I get the guest in the screen on\nthe\nright\npeople that is am not hearing either in\nthe stud to vot now whether they\nwant people want to\nvot s calm down s calm down s sidat calm\ndown s listen to me I'm finished today\nyou are fully aware that the case is\nturning and Sanjay Singh has been Sanjay\nSingh is not running the government in\nDelhi nikel I cannot hear you in the\nstudio at all I don't know you're\nbecause\nI\nuh today s Singh is not running the\ngovernment in Delhi Manish is sodia is\nnot running the government in Delhi\nsatendra Jen is not running the\ngovernment in Delhi if these three\nindividuals are not running the\ngovernment in Delhi because they are\nfrom jail sadhart then how can arind\nkajal run as chief minister from jail\narind krial has denied any of these\nindividuals s that he Arin krial has\nsaid that once you go to jail you cannot\nbe in the cabinet then how does that\nsame rule not apply to him this is a\nrule that he brought in he quickly\nremoved his existing ministers and\nbrought in atii why can't atishi be\nchief minister of\nDelhi I while he in jail when he comes\nout if he's cleared then he can take\nover\nagain what I answered earlier to your\nquestion about the timeline of man\nshould be the minister I will not go go\ninto repeating repeating it again\nsuffice to say that Delhi has a\ngovernance model arind krial as of now\nis the chief minister of Delhi where\ndoes the Constitution stop ask Mr krial\nto run Delhi from X Y or Zed Place\nanybody in the BJP can show it BJP\ncannot show it so let us agree let us\nstop it at that now as far as Public\nImage is concerned as far as politics is\nconcerned amadm party and the people of\nDelhi have overwhelmingly said that they\nhave voted for arind krial to serve\nserve them and they don't really care\nfrom where he serves as long as he\nserves them and that is what AM admy\nparty is doing and that is what has\nspooked BJP to this extent today that\nwith today itself I at the cost of\nrepetition I'll say AR today itself in\nthe court the the Ed said that arind\nkrial is neither an accused as a person\nnor does it have any nor is it asking AR\nwho has said all this who has said what\nare you\naccus Le by even Chang within two hours\nthe only thing that changed is has been\nyou you are not arrested you don't get\nba like this what are you saying his\nlawyer Wasing to the today\npleasure that he's not arrested why the\nrelas because the evidences were so\nclear about him knew\nthat\nmakes no\nsense something is sensible that this\ndebate can be taken further you are you\nare trying to create stories which is\nnot true at all you cannot challenge the\nDemocracy like\nthis your lawyers today begging that\nplease what did the lordship say the\nlordship clearly said what are\nsay change the story as you want India\ntoday in the next\nmonths\nnobody Congress has joined the protest\non\nground sing now now my question to n and\nnil and subra is n nikil nikil and subra\non the screen please and can I have the\naudio in the studio nikil the congress\nparty had said that arind krial should\nbe arrested because he's The Mastermind\nof corruption in the liquor gate\nscam today the government has done what\nthe Congress\nwanted this was the very statement of\nthe Congress that the am admi party is\nat the center of liquor gate and arvind\nkrial is The\nMastermind I can't and Arin krial should\ntherefore be\narrested the audio is not clear I can't\nhear\nyou\nnot\nArab may I may I have just been informed\nthat the Congress that the congress\nparty is joining the protest so I'm\nreminding everyone yes subra coming to\nyou I'm reminding everyone that it is\nthe congress party which had said that\narind krial should be arrested because\nof lior gate so please keep that in mind\nwhen the congress party joins the\nprotest along with the aadmi party\ntonight yes\nsubra uh Arab there are two three things\nwhich are very Clear Point number one\ntoday arind krial has\nlost any kind of moral High Ground that\nhe was in he should take moral\nresponsibility and he should resign I\nthink I don't want to get into\nlegalities right now but this is what he\nshould do Point number two this country\nhas had a you know that there have been\nprecedence in the past we have seen yua\nGI um bharati G Lau yadav g j Lita G all\nresign they never said I I didn't hear\nthis Narrative of there is emergency in\nthe country that there is politics\nhappening all around people when they\nwere accused when lot of evidences came\nto the\nForefront they fought the entire case\nthey did continue in politics nobody's\nasking Arin krial to resign from\npolitics but the Constitutional post\nthat he has there is a sanctity attached\nto the post and for the different kind\nof politics that he was trying to\nendorse I think he should just take\nmoral responsibility and\nresign also you know uh there are lot of\nthese big talks being made by amadm\nParty leaders let us\nunderstand arind krial I'm talking\nespecially to about the India Alliance\nleaders if these guys are fighting for\nthe Constitution and fighting for the\nrule of law and fighting for different\nthe sanctity of different\ninstitutions\nI don't understand this what are you\ntalking about that political leaders in\na country have to bow down\nbefore dict prime minister what are you\ntalking about I'm talking about the fact\nthat when you are\ngiven look at the principal opposition\nparty of the country the congress party\nall it bank accounts have been frozen JM\nchief minister has been put behind bars\ndeputy chief minister of Delhi has been\nbehind bars now the chief minister of\nDelhi is behind bars none of these\npeople have been convicted you're\ntalking about l l resigned from the he\nwas convicted by a byess not\nby over me I'm not yet done what you are\ndoing right now is putting the entire\nbehind chares\nwithout democracy country world is\nlooking at us and made this country into\na mockery for the past 74 years India\nhas been a Democratic Republic despite\nbeing a poor country with a low literacy\nlevel when he started out when the\nBritish maintain Contin to be a\ndemocracy through successive parties and\ngovernments but you're the Supreme I'm\nsorry to break this news to you India's\ndemocracy does not seek validation from\nAR Chief ministership let it sink in\nyour head if AR krial has committed has\ncommitted grave Financial errors he will\nhave to go to jail without any\nconviction by a court of law what are we\ntalking about what mockery is this we\nare talking about the sanctity of\nconstitutional institutions in this\ncountry we are talking about a fact that\nthere is G man in Delhi who is being\narrested by the\npolice\nref shamess and do not his he does not\nhave the\nmoral\nthe thew Notting on them tell you\nagain remaining in\npolitic\nnot a validation it's not a criteria of\nhow my democracy functions how can you\nnot\nseean before I get S back\ncompan you are toward\nthe one minute can I get Hakim in please\nthank you replace on the\nright n thanks very much hakeim if krial\nis made and accused formally then should\nhe quit\nat least if he's formally made an\naccused like sanj Singh was formally\nmade an accused two days back if he's\nformally made an accused in liquor gate\nwhich seems\nlikely then should he\nquit I can't hear him in the studio\nplease can you unmute yourself\nplease\nokay I don't think I can hear hakeim\nthere the question that emerges right\nnow can I go to shaan please if I can go\nlive to the shots full frame ladies and\ngentlemen I want to see what exactly is\ngoing on at the spot right now because\nit's been a very very long time we are\nwaiting for any information on what's\nHappening I would like to stay with\nthose pictures yes ADI thank you very\nmuch I'd like to stay with the pictures\nand viewers I'll give you a commentary\nover what's going on uh I'm getting the\nfreeze frame pictures I'm sure there are\nlots of feeds there right now I'm sure\nwe have Shan live on deepak's camera and\nI hope that that camera can be made to\nbe live dpti if it's not a problem uh\nshaan can you hear me can I take shaan's\naudio because he can completely hear me\nnot get the pixelated frame on the\nscreen but I would like the non-\npixelated video over shaan's video adti\ncan you please do that thank you so much\nshaan what's happening please what's\nhappening right now\nplease all the\nprocedures I can't hear\nyou by the time we correct the audio of\nthe amadm party and Congress have joined\nforces the Congress leaders you have\nsandip diit you have arender Singh Lely\nyou have the complete congress party\nparty Delhi unit coming out in support\nof the amadm party But the irony is that\nthe Punjab unit of the Congress that is\nthe vice president of the Congress\nPradesh Committee of Punjab has come out\nand welcomed the move of arrest of Arin\nkrial so it's a clear divide uh in the\ncongress party in Delhi they come out\nand support and they are protesting\nright on the streets with the supporters\nof the amadm party while in Punjab the\nsame Congress part is welcoming the move\nof the arrest of arind krial both are on\ncamera on record statements over clear\ndivision no Clarity but that's the story\nof the congress party so but what what\nis intriguing me right now is why they\nhave not been able to bring arind krial\nout of the house process I would be I\nwould be very very keen to know what\nexactly is going on the process doesn't\nhappen so far it took 6 hours obviously\nno\nno with it took but this is clearly a\nsituation here where the Ed is facing\nsome discomfort inside and Arvin krial\nknows that he can stretch this obviously\npolitically the game plan here is to get\nthe maximum number of people outside the\nresidence and make it difficult make it\nuh make it as difficult as possible and\nmake a big political spectacle out of it\nabishek I mean that's what I'm seeing\nhere because it's extraordinary if he\nhas been arrested at around 9:00 sharp\n9:00 on top of 9 then this is taking\nextremely long it's been 2 hours and the\nentire force of the Ed has been unable\nto take krial out no I'm getting to hear\nthat in that entire neighborhood there\nare long Jam long jams and there is\nmobilization happening these are people\nwho are not there just because they\nhappen to be there but they have been\nbrought in and so obviously as sh shaan\nwas also mentioning that there was\nbriefly a Law and Order situation also\nso so every attempt is being made to\nobviously intimidate the agencies into\nconduct conducting themselves in a\ncertain fashion remember just a couple\nof hours back before the news broke of\narrest of Arin krial the agency had to\nrequisition security from Delhi police\nfor their heads from crpf or Pal all the\ncomplete par paramilitary forces have\nbeen called in and that was someone was\njust showing us you have atii coming\nthere you have SAR badw coming there you\nhave the complete you have at least 30\nmlas of the Amad party and then calling\ntheir supporters raki has been detained\nso all of this is been deliberately done\nand those are the live visuals coming in\nof crpf and rap which has been deployed\nright outside but those those Lanes of\ncivil lines of Delhi that is old Delhi\nso roads are not that broad so Delhi\npolice is trying to create that space so\nthat the Ed Vehicles can move out they\nhave barricaded they have put in jammas\nand that's why we having difficulty in\ngetting Shan's frame which we will be\ngetting within the next 30 seconds yes\nso maybe the delay is assur just because\nthe agencies want to be doubly sure that\nthere is no Law and Order situation when\nthe chief minister of Delhi is brought\nwhat the try to do I think the delay is\nthat you are dealing with a chief\nminister he knows procedural issues he\nwill have his people around him he can\nmake uh several reasons to delay it I\nknow he can't he knows he can't delay it\nindefinitely but he can delay it by\nanother couple of hours he me he knows\nthat people are watching par movement\nhappen their legal team is at the he's\ngoing to buy time till he can get a\nmidnight hearing once they know that\nmidnight hearing is happening or not\nhappening and on that itself we have got\nvery differing uh feedback initially we\nwere told there will be a midnight\nhearing but then after that I thought\nthere was a statement I'm not sure by\nthe by abishek Manu singi who came and\nsaid no we are not pushing for a\nmidnight hearing at all not\nand then there was another turn and they\nup said again that no no we want a\nmidnight we don't know and I I\npersonally do not expect the Supreme\nCourt to be that overindulgent in this\ncase Okay Shan is just giving some\ninformation or that he's saying that the\ndelay is happening because the arrest\nmemo has to be signed by Arin krial\nwhich he has not signed so he's once\nagain not cooperating so this prec\nsaying that it's Arin krial who's\nblocking it yes and who's refusing to\ncooperate knowing fully well that\nthere's a situation that is developing\noutside now if in a situation he knows\nthat he's foul of the law but he's not\nfoul of politics so it's a smart game by\nArin krial where he's saying I don't\ncare I'm going to be arrested anyway I'm\ngoing to make this some kind of arrest\nout here and I'm going to stand there\nand I'm going to make it extremely\ndifficult and I hope that at the same\ntime while I'm doing that thousands of\npeople will gather outside my house and\nthis is a matter which is going to get\nme a lot of publicity in a short or\nlimited run he knows that he has this\ntime period between now and when he's in\ncustody because once he's in custody\nEverything Changes it is the short\nwindow that he has now which he's going\nto capitalize the most out of and that\nis exactly what we are seeing here\ntonight ladies and gentlemen it's a very\ninteresting play it's very interesting\ndevelopments very close developments\nvery fast developments which are\nhappening here we are told right now and\nthat's the breaking news on the grid\nthat arind krial is refusing to sign the\narrest memo but there must be a way\nbeyond that I I don't know if shaan is\non with us but there has to be a way\nbeyond that shaan that even if someone\ndoes not sign an arrest memo that way\nnobody would ever be arrested if every\nperson who was an accused or someone who\nwas going to be picked up knew that by\nnot signing the arrest memo a person\nwould uh would avoid being arrested then\nit would be a very convenient way of\never nobody ever being arrested so I\ndon't think this is going to work uh so\nlet me see if I have with me uh uh Hakim\nriswan yet shaan is back I think we have\na better frame of him shaan what's going\non you gave an update shaan some time\nback we heard that update we just\ncarried it that K is not signing the\narrest memo now that you are in and we\nare getting your frame tell us\neverything that we missed last 20\nminutes well in fact the arrest memo has\nalready been served but he has to sign\nthat there has been a considerable de\nthe last update I got\nthat the signature of the chief minister\nit's pretty\nmuch also employed by Sur in fact there\nwas almost 3 hours delay by can I get\nhis mic a he was given the arrest M\naround 9:00 in the evening can I get his\nmic switched on camera to please hold on\nand see if I can get the mic\nconnected can you get your mic connected\nI'm getting your Ambiance audio but your\nmic audio is not coming shaan your mic\naudio is not coming so you need to get\nyour mic connected you need to tell your\ncameraman to check his connection with\nyour\nmic or maybe you're holding the wrong\nmic thank\nyou Shan trying to fix his mic\nshaan yes I can hear you now go on shaan\nit's better now go on go\non go on we can get out of the seven\nwindow for a bit adii and get Shan back\non the frame thank you now just just\ntake a look at it now right now right\nnow this is exactly what's happening you\nhave Amad party workers just outside his\nresidence they've blocked the entire\nroad so there is certainly a Law and\nOrder situation that's developing at the\nsame time Arvin krial hasn't signed the\narrest memo that's the reason other\nreason why there has been a delay but\nremember that's purely a tactic that is\nemployed by everyone in fact even hon\nSurin did the same thing uh on of that's\nthe reason why now the fact of the\nmatter is that they will in a short\nwhile from now if at all Arin K does not\nhe also knows that that goes against him\nbecause this is something that will be\nhighlighted when he's actually produced\nbefore the court and that can actually\nonce again go against Arvin krial show\nshowing that he hasn't been cooperating\nwith the agency the agency right now\nperhaps you know being a little lenient\nbut at the same time this works in favor\nof the agency if at all this continues\nbecause remember right now as we speak\nthere is a clear Law and Order situation\nas you can see the rapid action force\nhas already been brought in there is an\naltercation that's going on between the\namadm party workers and the Delhi police\nas well as the rapid action for this\nentire area has been completely blocked\nso if you see on on the right hand side\non my right hand side straight down is\nAR K W's resident that area has been\ncompletely blocked barricaded at least\ntwo layers of barricading has already\nbeen done and the reason why the reason\nwhy there is another company that has\nnow been brought in from the other side\nso there are two gates here or no there\nare two gates gate number one that you\nsee right now on my screen I'll just ask\nmy camera person to move a little ahead\na little fast to actually quickly show\nyou as the movement basically takes\nplace that's the gate number one on the\nother side is gate number two from the\nfrom where the other vehicles are also\nmoving in so they're trying to clear\nthis off look at on my right hand side\nwhere the area was completely blocked so\nthere is the situation Still Remains a\nlittle volatile right now in terms of\nthe Law and Order situation hence the\ndelay\nI'm seeing that situation there I don't\nthink this is going to work well for Mr\nkrial at all I think Shaban you are\nright stay there I need your frame I\nneed your shot there completely you are\non camera non-stop shaan we have you\nfull frame on the screen so you're\nmoving towards there I mean can we speak\nto any of these people who are trying to\nput out these protests because I I think\nthat what we are hearing here is that uh\nthe Supreme Court registry has not taken\na decision yet on this matter just told\nthem\nyeah so the Supreme Court registry does\nnot take a final decision on this matter\nthen they they will try and hold this\noff so there are two parallel things\nhappening a legal process that's going\non where the op is trying to go to the\nSupreme Court I don't know if they\nregistry we have the petition we have\nthe petition we have the diary number so\nthe diary number is 13598 sl202 4 it has\nbeen filed at 857 the case it is still\nshowing pending so we have the we have\nthe case file number it is\nup on this please can team please\nconnect ryth an BW we get a legal view\non on that as well so when we have that\nwe will try and connect her we'll get\nher on a zoom link but there's this huge\nprotest going on outside the house and I\nthink the courts will take a very dim\nview of this because this is\nobstructionist you are stopping the\ninvestigating agency from continuing\nwith a due legal process the gentleman\nhas been arrested the roads have been\nblocked uh absolute non-cooperation\ngoing on inside so while they're buying\ntime and this may look like a very\nworthwhile tactic I think it's going to\nbe a blowback in the short to medium\nterm uh what do you think subra you're\nwatching this uh live drama going on\nright now uh what do you think is the\ngame plan what is what is on kajal's\nmind as he faces this\nmoment um I I think Arab that krial will\ntry to make as many political benefits\nas he will'll try to reap as many\npolitical benefits he can out of this uh\nthis entire uh drama which is which is\nfair because if if if the Amad party\npoliticians keep saying that this is all\npolitical then he you know the arrest is\npolitical then might as well uh uh you\nknow make a spectacle out of it I I\ndon't think anybody would mind that\nhowever the larger question in front of\nall of us is this People Like Us who\ngenuinely believed in the power of\nRevolution who genuinely believed that\nthere is an arm admy getting to the\nchief ministerial position and trying to\nbring in some changes what is going to\nhappen to to this generation I don't\nthink India for the next 30 40 years can\nwake up to any kind of political\nrevolution anymore now this is a really\nthis is a real sad day for uh for any\nkind of political hope in this country\nthis is what I have to say on this\nentire\nFiasco so you know viewers I look at\nthis right now and the kind of company\nthat arind krial now is in abishek Lalu\nPrasad yadav Lalu Prasad y was also\narrested uh 1997 for the F scam case and\nsome people thought oh there's going to\nbe overwhelming amount of political\nsupport for him but Lalu Prasad Yad went\nto jail for the first time for 135 days\nthen again 1998 he went in for 73 days\nthen in 2000 he went in uh for the\ndisproportionate assets case and after\nthat the party's support base actually\nfell the rjd faced a massive fall got 22\nseats which just 18% vote share in 2010\nand the question is whether the am admi\nparty krial is of course younger but\nhe's Lalu was approximately kajal's age\n25 years back krial would be about 56 57\nso you know it's it's it's it's not\nimpossible that the BJP strategy is that\nif you get the main man in jail then\nit's very difficult to keep a party\ntogether outside well also also the fact\nthat there is no structure within the\narm\njust one man show one so obviously when\nthere are no internal institutions or\nstructures it collapses if the one man\nwho's running the show goes so it's not\ngoing to be easy for the aadmi party uh\nif the if if if as the jail manual says\nthat krial can't run the government from\ninside the jail then obviously the\nowners comes to the next person\navailable and in the absence of\nstructures it becomes a free for all so\nuh it's not going to be and and remember\nit's not like in the case of Ru Prasad\nyadav there was a family holding the for\nnow the other the other point is if\nlegally nikil tomorrow if legally this\nmatter goes this way that the Supreme\nCourt uh that the courts deny bail to\narind\nkrial at this point of time we being no\nspecial bench of the Supreme Court being\nset up tonight to urgently have the the\nDelhi CM Arvin kajal's petition\nchallenging is there is no special bench\nof the Supreme Court so no midnight\nhearing that's what\nsure that abish Manu singi would have\nknown that this is only buying time let\nme tell you the arind krial knows that\nunder 99% of the time he will not get a\nspecial hearing this is all buying time\nwhat is happening outside is the real\nstory they want a lot of people outside\nso that when they know that when krial\nis taken out after 12:00 there'll be a\nlarge number of people they will make it\na moment for opposition Unity etc etc\nbut nikel if krial is denied bail I'm\nsure these lawyers are going to rush for\nbail if he's denied bail once twice\nThrice then the going gets tough doesn't\nit AR then the BJP succeeds in its idea\nof creating a constitutional crisis in\nDelhi that you have an elected chief\nminister who's being kept in custody\nbehind jail without any conviction by a\ncourt of law this is classic case of\nbeing afraid of the opposition that is\nwhat Narendra Modi is doing right now\ngoing the Supreme Court the Supreme\nCourt has denied bail to\nthe Supreme Court has denied the courts\nhave denied the police has just arrived\nI'm getting visuals there Shan if I can\nget his audio ladies and gentlemen moved\nout being moved out being moved out is\nno I think vehicles are moving inic the\nvehicles are moving in right all these\nmoved out this looks like moving\nout this this looks like one minute can\nI have n for a\nminute a huge carcade just went out was\nthat arind krial being taken out I'm\nthese are shots of him being taken out\ncan I please have I am told arind krial\nhas been taken out krial is being taken\nout krial has been taken out from his\nresence I'm not getting the updates can\nI go full frame with those shots ADI\njust as I said we can spare n for a\nminute thank you very much okay this is\nthis is an ani feed this is uh this is\nnot the shaan's feed from the ground so\nthis is possibly uh from a different Tak\nout Tak out we heard he taken out so\nthere are two shots shaan we are being\ntold he's been taken out from Another\nSide we shaan we just been told he's\nbeen taken out from Another Side we're\ngetting the carcade shots what are you\ngetting is information shaan we are told\nthat from another location arind krial\nhas been taken out he's on route to the\nEd office what are you hearing\nshaan shaan what are you hearing shaan\nwhat are you hearing he's just been\ntaken out he he's been taken out from\nthe other gate he's been taken out from\nthe other gate we'll just try and move\nto this side because there's a\npossibility is there's a possibility\nthat they would be taking this route\nbecause if you see uh there has been\nsecurity that has been brought in this\nside too I'll just quickly probably step\non this side and see if I can get a\ncloser look of that caret that is\nbasically moving in right now it's\nexpected it's expected that it'll be\ncoming out in a short while so we\nshowing you from the other gate that's\nthe other gate on from where the\nmovement has actually taken place uh\nthis area has now been cleared a short\nwhile back this was completely blocked\nhe's going to straight away taken to the\nenforcement director's headquarters\nwhere a medical team from rml hospital\nhas already been brought in so a medical\nexamination takes place immediately\nafter he is brought to the enforcement\ndirector's headquarters in the national\ncapital and there after and we do have a\ncamera there Deepak Deepak in fact\nDeepak is there on at outside the\nenforcement director's office where he\nwill be taken it's roughly about 30 30\nto 35 minutes or that right there's no\ntraffic he's going to be straight away\ntaken to the where the examination takes\nplace and immediately after the medical\nexamination gets over uh perhaps there\nis a possibility that the questioning\nwill actually continue because uh what\nis essentially going to happen is that\ntill the time he is produced before the\nRouse Avenue Court we let's just see I\nbelieve there's some movement this side\nlet's just move\ntowards yeah we're just moving towards\nuh the other gate on up right now to see\nif we can just get a quick glimpse of\nthat cavate that's moved out right now\nit appears that they've taken that while\nmeanwhile at the others take out Shan at\nthe others take out I have Deepak with\nme at the Ed office shaan the media is\nwaiting there at the Ed office any\nincling you got because Deepak we got\ninformation about 6 minutes back that\nthere was movement I don't know uh from\none of the gates there is news that uh\nuh 10 uh 11 10 to 11 uh uh vehicle\ncarcade has moved out of kajal's\nresidence uh with a lot of siren and is\nmoving towards the Ed office any\ninformation you have\nthere uh right Arab right now the only\nthing that we can see right now and I\ncould ask my video journalist to show is\nthat barricades have been set up at the\nentrance of the road that uh that leads\nuh to the enforcement directorates\nheadquarters and the police security is\nbeing ranked up with uh ramped up with\neach uh passing minute and the patrol\nvehicles are also on site here uh if I\ncould ask my video journalist to pan and\nshow you that these are the patrol\nVehicles these are Delhi police uh\nPatrol vehicles that are busy clearing\nthe streets right here uh in the road\nthat uh where the Ed headquarters is\nsituated and it's a 20 uh 20 minute\nroute from the Delhi Chief Minister's\nresidence till uh the Ed headquarters\nand all alonga what we witnessed is\nheavy deployment of police cover every\nuh Nook and corner off the roads off the\nroute lead leading up to the enforcement\ndirectorate's headquarters is completely\nramped up with the Delhi police taking\ncharge and also diverting traffic from\nuh the route to ensure that K wal's\nmovement is facilitated without ease and\nwithout any delay and right now what we\ngiven to understand is that as soon as\nArin krial arrives here he will be taken\ninside the Ed headquarters where a\nmedical team from the rml hospital has\nalready reached and they will be\nconducting the medical test of uh the\nDelhi chief minister after which the\nquestioning is likely to continue and if\nI could uh tell you what's happening\nhere the barricades have been set up\nhere the police uh deployment is also\nincreasing with each passing minute and\nwhat we have given to understand is that\nuh the security cover will only increase\nhere because am ADI Party leaders are\nalso expected to come here and round two\nof a blockade will also be witnessed\nhere because round one was at the Delhi\nChief Minister's residence and round two\nwill be at the Ed headquarters where the\namadm party leaders will have their last\nditch effort to stop the enforcement\ndirectorate from taking Arin krial\ninside the Ed headquarters for further\nquestioning and tomorrow according to\nsources Delhi chief minister if\neverything works out at the one minute\nhold on I'm getting rhythm in right now\nRhythm yeah Deepak one minute pleas VI\nwhat you're seeing on the left hand side\nare the visuals K that's coming in right\nnow court is not going to have any\nurgent midnight hearing tonight even\nthough he's it's he's challenging his\narrest by the enforcement directorate in\nthe Delhi lure policy case the hearing\nis going to only happen on Friday uh I\nalso tried to have a word with his\nlawyers today that is Dr abishek Manu\nsing's team that's going to be leading\nthis charge in the Supreme Court\ntomorrow uh they have tried to approach\nthe regist in fact we at Republic TV\nhave also tried tries to speak to the\nregistar and a few minutes ago when we\ntried to speak to him he said that till\nnow nothing had come forward before him\nnow the news that's coming in is that\nSupreme Court is not going to be giving\nany Hearing in this case today it's only\ngoing to be happening tomorrow like all\nof us have been discussing this is a\ncourse with the enforcement directorate\ncase but as of now no urgent midnight\nhearing as was being speculated by Arin\nkajal's team in the top Court of the\ncountry and they've been trying to seek\nan urg hearing they even tried to\napparently go to the registrar's house\nbut the registar has not stated anything\nit is at the discretion of the Chief\nJustice of India if any midnight hearing\nis given and it's not going to happen\ntonight only tomorrow as per protocol\nthis case is going to be heard in the\nSupreme Court let's also update our\nviewers on why there is no occasion for\na midnight Hearing in this case uh uh we\nremember it was even earlier when Manish\nhad been arrested last year around this\ntime but he's been denied bail in these\ncases now the matter is how soon once he\napproaches the Supreme Court will the\nSupreme Court intervene in such cases\neven though a big human cry is being\nmade by the arm admy party legally\nspeaking there are very rare chances\nthat the Supreme Court will interfere in\nthe powers of the enforcement\ndirectorate this is also after the\nSupreme Court's judge judement that has\ncome Justice khilar the former Supreme\nCourt Judge had given a judgment in the\nenforcement on on the powers of the\nprevention of money laundering Act and\nthe powers of the Ed which were making\nit the dictat very clear when it comes\nto arrest when it comes to summons the\nEd has power or up that power cannot be\ntaken away just because a human cry is\nbeing made by the arm admy party and I I\nI also onee hold your breath and I want\nto ask you a question uh I want to ask\nyou question\nhere uh yes okay we have a bite of Sor\nbadage we'll play that and then I'm\ncoming back to\n[Music]\nyeah\nevidence\nproper opposition\nAR\narind arind\n[Music]\nIDE\nsh\nSupreme\narrest Court registry\nsueme\n[Music]\n[Music]\ncour\nIM\nin\ncabinet\nproposals\ncircul\nSU\ncongresses allia\nCongress Sam party\nsay home akiles yadav\nG Priyanka Gandhi Rahul\nGandhi\nk\n[Music]\ntop\n[Music]\nLe\npart\nV\nladies and gentlemen sorab baj is there\nand my question is to you know this\nexample was really bizarre when he said\nthat sub Sahara of the Sahara group he\nalso ran Sahara B conglomerate from the\njail it's a terrible\nexample uh now Rhythm if this matter\ncomes up in the Supreme Court\ntomorrow the Supreme Court has always\nbeen emphasizing on newe\nprocess what can Arin krial really\nexpect\nhere if it is uh due\nprocess then what really is the example\nwhich can be\ncited by their lawyers before The\nSupreme Court and what's the history of\nhow the court usually deals with cases\nlike this well uh Arab in such cases one\nhas to understand he is challenging his\narrest if he's challenging his arrest\nthe Supreme Court is going to be hearing\nthe case they're going to be hearing the\nchallenge also from the enforcement\ndirectorate they're going to be seeing\nthe behavior of the accused and I want\nto remind our viewers this is not just\nsome ordinary person here he's been\nnamed as the 32nd accused 32 30 second\naccused in The Lure scam case if we\nactually see the sheer number of times\nArvin krial has been summoned and he's\nnot come to the enforcement directorates\noffices it's n today was the ninth time\nraids have been conducted in this\nparticular case in 245 locations across\nIndia when we talk about the lure scam\ncase oror when we been hearing and\nseeing the six Char sheets filed in this\ncase it's a very serious case we at\nRepublic TV have been debating it for\nthe longest time if I can also just take\nour viewers towards what really is the\ncase because uh this is not just some\nrandom arrest or a political move that\nhas been made but an arrest that has\nbeen made after very very crucial\ndetails that come out in the lior scam\ncase which have people who are very\nclose to arind kajal being named here\nthere was a person called Vijay ner the\nEd had long ago stated that vij n had uh\nthat 100 CR rupees Kickbacks had been\npaid in advance to vij n who was the am\nadmy party's Communication in charge\nthere were also soria's former secretary\nwho spilled the beans and who gave lots\nof details into 2022 in December to the\nenforcement directorate what is the Ed\nnow saying the Ed says a conspiracy has\nbeen hatched by political leaders that\nincludes Arin kajal Manish Soria and now\nK kabita who was arrested last week in\nthis case he's of course the first\nhigh-profile person to be arrested but\nit takes time for an investigation to\ncontinue and to come to terms with this\ncase is really pertaining to money\nlaundering charges which the Delhi\ngovernment's excise policy of 2021-22\nhas spoken about they had also claimed\narm admy party received Kickbacks they\nalso spoke about 100 CR rupees Kickbacks\nin the excise policy his name had not\nbeen mentioned earlier but in multiple\nchart sheets kad's name came and finally\nit was him who was named as the 32nd\naccused or up even as we speaking about\nthis dramatic visuals on the screen\nwhich are clearly showing the arm admi\nparty is going to try and derive as much\npolitical mileage as they can today\nbecause there will be protests that\ncontinue to be held their legal team is\ngoing to try and go to the registrar's\noffice but the word from the Supreme\nCourt is clear no midnight Hearing in\nsuch a case it's only tomorrow that the\ncase will be heard if I can actually\ntell our viewers once again what's been\nhappening in the case there was also the\n45 CR rupees bride that had been spoken\nabout for the Goa assembly elections\nthis is also something mentioned in one\nof the six chart sheets that had been\nfiled by the enforcement director in\nthis case the financial crimes probe\nagency had also stated that there were\nseveral individuals including\nparliamentarians who will be in this\ncase we also of course know Manish Soria\nand sing San Singh are currently lodged\nin thear jail in the very same case The\nLure scam case is is clearly something\nnow that's going to be haunting the arm\nadmy party and they have a lot of\nevidence with them when they say this uh\nin fact in one of the chart sheets the\nEd has also pegged the losses at\n2,873 CR rupees so or when be talking\nabout this kind of a motivated illegal\nuh money laundering case in proceeds of\ncrime case as the Ed has stated one has\nto be very clear they have immense\nevidence before them in fact in some of\nthe chart sheets that I had also gone\nthrough it was very they IM evidence\nkept cropping up yes so uh there was\nalso the South group that was comprising\nof businessman Sarat ready there was\nalso magun Shas shasu Ry who were a part\nof that I remember reading in K Kavita\nit was stated that in Delhi under nine\nzones out of 32 in Delhi under the new\nexcise policy there was an\nextraordinarily High 12% profit margin\nfor wholesalers and almost\n185% margin that had been given for\nretailers 6% of the 12% margin was to be\ncollected back for the hair wholesalers\nas Kickback this is about proceeds of\ncrime this is about Kickback I'm going\nto simplify this for the viewers uh\nbecause like I said we need to\nunderstand the lure scam is something\nwe've been debating for the past two\nyears it's not suddenly Arisen kajal's\narrest was imminent today he's been\nnamed as the 32nd accused there are six\nhuge char sheets in this case there are\npeople who've been arrested there are\npeople who spilled the beans in fact\npeople who are close to them who spilled\nthe beans and have spoken about it this\npolicy that had started the Delhi excise\npolicy was later scrapped the agency had\nalleged that accused were in touch with\nkrial for formulating the excise policy\nhe skipped summons the Ed also claimed\nthat there was a\nconspiracy uh I also want to tell our\nviewers here about like I said Vijay n\none of the key people who was earlier\narrested 100 KY CR rupees Kickback that\nwas spoken about earlier it said he was\nmanaging the scheme and was conspiracy\non behalf of the arm practically\nspeaking uh\nRhythm we are getting some action from\noutside the Ed i' like to go to the\npictures there uh live full frame please\nDeepak I can see the cars are reaching\nfull frame\npictures will be carried out and after\nwhich the questioning will uh continue\nand tomorrow he will be he will be\npresented before the pmla court these\nare live visuals from the Ed\nheadquarters kibal is on his way and he\nwill be arriving in just moments from\nnow this is the first round of cavalcade\nthat has uh LED kajal's Convoy and after\nthis this is just the first wave of the\npolice vehicles that are arriving at the\nenforcement directorates headquarters\nand after this krial will be arriving at\nat the headquarters where he will be\nquestioned a medical test will be done\nand after which he will be uh produced\nbefore a pmla cour tomorrow right now\nthis is uh these are the live visuals\nfrom the enforcement directorates\nheadquarters the security has been\nbeefed up and the barricades have been\nput in place in moments from now Arin\nkrial will be here at the enforcement\ndirector's\nheadquarters we're getting different\nshots there uh stay with us deep right\nnow uh this is the massive security\ndeployment that has been done at the\nenforcement directorates headquarters\naround 100 Delhi police Personnel have\nbeen deployed at the enforcement\ndirectorate's headquarters\nnow a team of the enforcement\ndirectorate according\nto well we are getting some live visuals\nof vehicle movement from uh the Delhi\nChief Minister's residence this is the\nfirst wave of vehicles that has arrived\nat the enforcement directores\nheadquarters of kyal will be coming in\nvery soon right\nnow another another set of vehicles have\nuh reached the\nDelhi have reached the headquarters of\nthe enforcement\ndirectorate well uh a wave of Delhi\npolice convoys have started arriving at\nthe enforcement directores headquarters\nwell we saw from all directions Delhi\npolice these are the seizures from the\nkall's\nresidents and very soon Arin krial will\nalso be brought this is extra deployment\nof police that is being pressed in at\nthe enforcement directorates\nheadquarters another police van has\narrived at the enforcement directorates\nheadquarters to prevent any sort of\nuntoward incident that is expected to\ntake place because round one was at the\nDelhi Chief Minister's residence in\ncivil lines and right now amadm Party\nleaders are also expected to come here\nto block the enforcement directorate\nfrom taking Arin Kwal inside the\npremises of the enforcement directory\nheadquarters so the Delhi police is\nmaking sure that uh no situation goes\nout of hand and in order to ensure that\nadditional forces are also being\ndeployed this is another van of Delhi\npolice which has arrived at the\nenforcement directorate\nheadquarters yes and we are staying with\nthese live visuals and these are also\npictures of Arin krial the deputy the\nDelhi chief minister has vess her first\nvisuals after arrest in the police car\nthat's a police car in which Arin krial\nhas been taken out of his residence he's\nabout to reach we have our colleague\ndeepal Deepak live there right outside\nEd headquarters we have our multiple\nteams there shavan is at the Arin krial\nresidence he's also reaching Ed\nheadquarters and now Deepak we are being\ntold that more and more cars are coming\nin he's in a white and over we can see\nhim uh can you also spot that white\nwhite color yeah white color\nmuv Deepak no Arab over you right now\nthat uh that car that we're speaking\nabout hasn't arrived yet what has\narrived here is uh a slew of convoys of\nthe Delhi police and uh when we showed\nright about a few seconds back another\npoliceman has also arrived at the Ed\nheadquarters to prevent any sort of\nuntoward incident because amadm Party\nleaders are also expected to arrive here\nin large numbers to block the uh you\nknow block the enforcement director from\ntaking kial inside so what will follow\nafter he's taken into inside the Ed\nheadquarters is that a medical checkup\nwill be done a tight security is in\nplace and after the medical checkup by\nthe rml health\nofficial if I may say so so\nfar uh one of the dangers\nP one of the dangers for the aadmi party\nis that by Nature it's an extremely\ncentralized party people\ndecision making is extremely\ncentralized uh there are no clear\nstructures of\norganization uh\ncontrol and the danger for the aadmi\nparty I'm not talking anything else here\nthe legality of course whether the\nSupreme Court entertains them tomorrow\nwe'll have to see but the danger will be\nthat this is a party which is a very\nflat structure\nyeah and the only structure that existed\np b\nbelow krial was an un written structure\nwhere Manish in the Delhi government it\nwas Manisha sodia in Parliament it was\nsanj sing\nyeah because everybody with else who was\nsenior with the Amad party is gone\nashutosh and all the others are gone\nit's they yogendra yadav ashutosh they\nare not\nthere and atii despite being finance\nminister is politically very raw right\nI'm just analyzing this politically\nshe's not considered to be senior at\nAlli s right yeah AI s both orshi and s\nbadw are both much younger less\nexperienced they will not be accepted as\nleaders by the remainder of the CER of\nthe amadm party so my question will be\non a practical level below the emotive\npart of it on a practical level there\nwill challenges will be if if arind\nkrial continues to be in jail for a\nmonth two months 3 months the\nextraordinary situation will develop for\nthe Amad\nparty well it is already an\nextraordinary situation because uh\nof the largest the fastest growing\npolitical party of the country has been\nput behind bars and um the accounts of\nthe largest opposition political party\nwere frozen you know uh we may call it\nuh that you know it is legal fair enough\nmight be legal you create laws in such a\nmanner that which gives you an\nopportunity to use it in a partisan\nmanner against the people whom you seem\nuh as threat to yourself so you know to\nmy mind this uh this is is a legalized\natrocity which the BJP has Unleashed on\nAmad party and Arin krial I am under uh\nyou know um No No Illusion that it is\ngoing to be difficult for arm admy party\nwithout Mr krial Mr krial is the\ninspiration from from whom the whole\nparty derives uh energy and uh but I\nthink the top leadership has made it\namply clear that it will be Mr krial\nonly who will running the government if\nbehind I'm pretty much\nsure when any when any when any party\nenters into a battle like this and you\nare saying that it is a battle I don't\ndisagree with you that it is a battle\nand I I'm we are under no illusions that\nthere is no political angle to this but\nwhen if any Center gets into a battle of\nthis kind it has to be confident enough\nto win you either get into the battle\nwhen you have enough facts with you now\nnow my question is Karan and push to\nboth of you if arind krial gets\nconvicted it might take a long time it\nmight take 3 months 6 months one year\nbut if there is a long period of his\nphysical absence by being in jail\nfollowed by a conviction on pretty much\nthe same grounds as Sanjay Singh and\nManish\nsodia then what happens he has reached\nif at the age of 56 or 57 whatever his\nage now he is a convicted person then\nwhat\nhappens how did the party T how does the\nparty tack it what happens to Amad ADI\nparty what happens to krial if he's\nconvicted honestly so the question Arab\nthe party has fallen apart I mean I\ndon't think it will fall apart it has\nfallen apart there's no credibility left\nwhen you skip eight summons when the\nSupreme Court says there is a money\ntrail of 338 crores established I think\nthat the the doors were closing on krial\nhe knew what Wasing coming his way\ncrying Vendetta or saying this is legal\natrocity it doesn't work now and people\nalso see this let's understand they've\nlost sympathy today people are no longer\nsympathizing with the am admy party they\nunderstand that liquor scam happened the\nCAG has pointed out a minimum loss of\n2,000 crores so people they've lost in\nthe eyes of the people also this has\ndented them politically this has dented\nthem legally and it's only fair that\nthey fall apart now because and it's a\ngreat Testament to our legal system the\nCM L resigned after he was convicted up\nsays kajal is not\nconvicted you\nknow was\nconvicted no was\nconvicted okay so let us go let us come\nback to the uh organization of aadmi\nparty okay like I come from the state of\nMP we might have lost badly here in the\nState Assembly elections I was one of\nthem who lost so that's fair enough that\nuh we were not able to Garner enough\nvotes apart from two or three seats in\nwhich we uh did all right okay in all\nother seats we did badly but this is\nthis is how it is done\nright as The Honorable Kashi used to say\nand we have we have we have our SE in\nthe state of madad have we have\norganization you are a party which is\ngrowing p p p p I know what you're\nsaying right but you are a party that is\nsupro Arin K you have a supro fallen\napart lost alled it's like today Trin\nCongress trinal Congress at least has a\nnumber two in Abhishek banery they don't\nbut am admy party does not have a number\ntwo nckl number two is you you know it's\na very big risk number two is also in\njail yeah number two number three number\nfour are in jail now it's a you are\nforgetting one man who is who who is\nright now\nwas being P to be the and by the way by\nthe way by the way lot of people\ncommenting lot of people commenting p on\nthe on the conspicuous absence absence\nof ragav chadda I'm told he's gone for\nsome eye surgery which is very necessary\nI wish him well I hope he recovers the\ntiming is interesting but he was caught\nwith a British and you know the fact\nthat he's choosing to be as far away as\npossible and for medical reasons of\ncourse and largely quiet away from\nPolitics on the Ed's part that they\nhad there a investigation as Min he was\ncalled a defacto chief minister in\nnumber two to Arin krial where is he\nyes well as you have yourself mentioned\nthat he has gone for an i Sur somebody\nin a surgery do expect them to come out\nof it and sit on the street in protest\nbecause the Ed chose to\narrest\nwhat line of argument is this yety oh is\nhe oh he's on the Streets of London he\nhe he's on the Streets of London with\nthe British Member of Parliament getting\npictures clicked just too\nbusy have to take a flight\nback you have to at least take a flight\nback you have to give the man that\nenough\ntime you have to give that man that\nenough time and quite interesting that\nwe've been talking about part enely\ndependent on one\nsupr\nnarra Modi what is the BJP without\nNarendra Modi today no no rhythm Rhythm\nor rather what is the BJP without the Ed\nCBI and all\nthis yes there are a battery of leaders\nin BJP is the biggest chance for arind\nkrial if if Arin krial does not get\nrelief before The Supreme Court tomorrow\nyes and given that the high court has\nnot been very charitable to him after\nseeing the preliminary evidence put\nbefore them in a sealed cover by the\ninvestigating agencies\ntoday if Arin krial does not get relief\ntomorrow from the Supreme Court does\nyour experience tell you that he is then\nin for a longer term in\ncustody or if you go by\nthe and the investigation that has been\ncarried on by the enforcement\ndirectorate in this case it is not a\ncase that is uh going to be seen as\nbeing very easy on Arin krial it's been\n2 years the case has been carrying on\nhe's the 302 accused like you yourself\nsaid that after after so much time after\nso much effort after vij n\nafter Manish soria's own secretary\nspills the bean only after evidence\nbeing collected from the south Lobby and\nthe fourth high-profile arrest in this\ncase of Arin krial is made I very much\ndoubt that the Supreme Court would like\nto interfere in a criminal investigation\nthat is being carried on by the\nenforcement directorate yes they will\ntry and move uh I'm also trying to get\nin touch with the legal team that is\nbeing led by senior Advocate Dr Abhishek\nManus singi in this case there has been\nfalse news that had been earlier given\nthat a midnight hearing would be care\nthere however the legal team has said\nplan they would only be for case in the\nSupreme Court and now the registrar's\noffice has also stated that there is no\nsuch chances of a midnight hearing\ncoming if we actually also uh look at\nwhat has been stated in the high court\nit's very evident and clear what the\nlegal team is actually going to be\nstating tomorrow it's not uh you know\nit's not anything different that they're\ngoing to be stating other than saying\nthat this is a politically motivated\ncase they're also going to be\nquestioning the powers of the\nenforcement directorate under the pmla\nACT which they're trying to challenge so\nup to shortly answer your question it's\ngoing to be extremely difficult for them\nto be able to get arind krial out by\nchallenging the statue and the\nenforcement directorate rules it is the\nSupreme Court's bench of justice khilar\nthat had ensured that the pmla ACT gets\nthe supremacy that it has and it's\nsupposed to also include political\nleaders who cannot get uh who cannot get\naway from the hands of an Central agency\nonly because they are political leaders\nkeeping that in mind uh it will be very\ndifficult to do anything but on one\nthing is for sure today after the\nmedical checkup Arvin krial is going to\nbe spending his night in the Ed lock up\nhe's not going to go anywhere he's not\ngoing to be allowed anywhere so this is\nalso going accus is he an\naccused is he an accused because I think\nASG Raju said something contrary to it\nin the Delhi High Court ASG Raju in the\nDelhi high court has said if he had\njoined one of the summons in the case we\nwould have been able to tell arind krial\nwhether we are calling him as an ACC\naccused or as a witness but yes after\nall the six charge sheets have been\nfiled he has been named as an accused\nwhen the case came up before the Delhi\nhigh court yesterday ASG Raju said at\nleast he should have answered one of the\nsummons then we would have told him\nwhether he's going to be seen as a\nwitness or an accused alas he never came\nfor any of the summons even Dr tother to\nthat Ry the question as by and many admy\nparty spokespersons as well that is he\nan accused now push you are fully aware\nthat Sanjay Singh was formally made an\naccused just two days back but he has\nbeen in custody for months now so that\nis not an argument which holds on your\nchannel I've been I I've been listening\nto this conversation and uh I got this\ninformation through through this this\nprogram only that he is the 30C accused\nso far I was not aware of\nit and I I don't think to my mind I may\nbe wrong please correct me if I'm\nwrong\nname TW of the you name ragav CH any\ntweet he says and he says what he has\nto he obviously an accused that's why\nhe's being arrested what you're talking\nabout is the formality of aring him as\nan accused in papers yeah that is that\nis that that's the legal part of\nit that's the legal part of it isn't it\nunless and until the Char sheet mentions\nhim names him as an accused how can we\nsay that he's an accused and if the six\nChar sheet does mention him as an\naccused then ASG will probably Li has 90\ndays\nbab I understand they have days I'm\nalready I'm already listening listening\nlistening listening about it on your\nchannel right that he is the 30C\naccused so the you know and that is the\nfact that has been put forth before\nbefore the country\nby by\nmyel whether ASG Raju the additional\nsolister General SV Raju who's been\nappearing in the case in the Supreme\ncourt and the lower courts and the Delhi\nhigh court yesterday mentioned it in so\nmany words or not uh is the fact that\nthis Ed has conducted all these\ninvestigations in 245 locations across\nIndia we also know finally he's been\narrested but uh you know if you just\nwant to go on Words the fact of the\nmatter also is he's going to be spending\nthis night in a lockup because of\nseveral reasons one of them of course\nbeing the entire\ninvestigation\nby for the last years in the money\nlaundering case to challenge the Eds\n[Music]\ndict seems to be little to get Bel that\nyou're looking for Arin krial in the\nSupreme Court tomorrow Ma'am that was a\nvery specific information that you\nprovided that he's the 30C accused in\nthe alleged Deli lior Gates Camp so that\nwas very specific information and the\nthe ASG never never said anything to\nthat effect in the in the uh you how do\nyou get this information on the basis\nthe chart sheet and the number of people\nwho have already been arrested there has\nbeen\nalso of other specific informations\nwhich you have very comfortably just\nsideline one minute one minute I I think\nshe he's trying to go by words I will\nsettle this matter P by saying that what\nshe has said and I will make it amply\nclear she has said there are six charge\nsheets in degate excise policy\ninvestigation she has said that 31\nindividuals and entities have been named\nincluding former deputy chief minister\nManish\nsodia MP of AP sanes Singh both sanes\nSingh and Manisha sodia are currently in\nthar jail and krial is the 32nd to be\narrested in this case now yeah so that's\nit that a matter of time before he's\nmade accused that was an assumption on\ntechnicalities the issue is what happens\npolitically\ncorre the only question right now is\nwhat will condu 70 or programs on this\nmatter you know this I think not on\ntechnicalities I am I am entirely on a\npoint right now that I would have got a\nsense of where things are going P based\nupon the views responses of the courts\nyou will agree with me you will agree\nwith me that the courts have not been\nvery charitable to the am admi party in\nliquor gate and that has been one of the\ndisappointments you have Ace lawyers on\nyour side abishek Manu singi is not like\nCaple he's a competent lawyer but you\nhave seen how unsuccessful even abishek\nManu singi has been in this case both\ncomp this case is not one on which there\nis any success so far it is comple is\nnot getting success despite pulling out\nall its legal as it is absolutely a\ncomplex case because still this is the\n202 video this is a 20 second long video\nwhere you see Arin krial getting\narrested okay viewers this picture there\nif you run it full frame it's a 20c\nvideo it's a 20 second video someone can\ndescribe it it is on the screen you will\nsee arind krial go in while he's being\narrested there is arind krial coming out\nI think I see him\nthere yeah and his onour with him yes\nhis family they moving very slowly and\nthen realizing his family standing there\nArin krial comes out and is being taken\nin the car all very\norderly and uh I think this is after\nthey realize that the Supreme Court is\nnot entertaining them shaan has the\nlatest while we stay on the pictures\nshaan what's up right\nnow well in fact he's going to be kept\ninside a lockup which is inside the\nenforcement director headquarters this\nis at the ground floor where he will be\nkept in a short while from now there\nwould be a team of the rml coming in\nfrom the rml hospital for the medical\ncheckup to be done after the medical\ncheckup is completed uh on no we give it\nto understand the questioning will\ncontinue because the latest update that\nI got after the team left from Arvin\nkajal's residence is that they have\nseized certain documents however the\nenforcement director were tight lift\nabout the nature of the documents that\nwere seized by the enforcement director\nwas it pertaining to the scam that is\nnot known at this point in time but they\nsay that they are going to examine these\ndocuments that have been seized from his\nresidents electronic devices have also\nbeen taken uh that has been seized a\nbackup would be taken up once uh they\nreach the enforcement director's office\nand is handed over to the investigating\nofficer a report is essentially going to\nbe prepared because it is expected\nroughly after 2:00 in the afternoon is\nwhen he's going to be produced before\nthe rousa court where the reand is bed\nanother big development because there\nwas a lot of speculation whether at all\nK Kavita has actually spilled the beans\nand is that the reason why the arrest\nhas taken place we are given to\nunderstand primarily on the basis of\ncertain statements that were recorded in\nthe last few months which includes\nwitness baguna Redi apart from that Bui\nBabu and Arun pilai their statements\nwere quite crucial because For the First\nTime the name of Arvin krial actually\nfigured and they' have specifically\nspoken about the meeting that took place\nbetween\nand\nkav that was between Kavita\nand there is a money Trail because\nthat's of course there is of course\nthere is a money trail that they are\nlooking at but one has to understand and\nnot fall into the Trap of what the am\nADI party wants everyone to believe that\nwhen you say money Trail there would be\nWS of cash lying around that's not what\nhappens because there is a haala\ntransaction that is taken place and\nlet's not forget there is also the role\nof satender Jen satender Jen was\nactually uh questioned by the\nenforcement director because it turns\nout that the transactions that have\nessentially taken place for the Goa\nelection has happened through haala\ntransactions multiple haala transactions\nand an out outdoor broadcasting\nadvertising company was actually paid\nallegedly by the amadm party and this\nmoney that was actually paid was the\nalleged Kickbacks received in the\nlickers camp that money went in for the\nGoa elections and that is the reason why\nevery time the am admi party says where\nis the money the response that comes in\nfrom sources within the enforcement\ndirector that it is perhaps laughable to\nexpect that someone would have kept the\nmoney in some sort of a bank Locker when\nthe money is actually moving around\nthrough haala operators that is the\nreason why they say that what is\nimportant here is witness statements and\nthese are statements that are taken\nunder oath these are statements that\nhave been recorded under Section 50 of\nthe pmla act and it stands before the\ncourt that is the reason why they are\nquite confident that the court will take\ncognizance of this matter and in the\nremand that is going to be produced\ntomorrow which is expected to be a\ndetailed remand including the statements\nthat were shown before the chief\nminister the chief minister was shown\nthe statements of maguna Redi and a few\nothers to which there was no response\nthat has been given in fact in the\ngrounds of arrest that have been shown\nthey've also indicated the fact that\nshown the statements say when he was\nconfronted with that he has he the\nrespons\nthe responses the responses were evasive\nhe hasn't he hasn't responded to any of\nthose statements that came in in fact\nthere was few other documents that were\nproduced One crucial document was of a\nman called C arind who used to be the\nprivate Secretary of the then deputy\nchief minister manise sodia because the\ndraft policy was actually certain notes\nwere provided at the chief Minister's\nresidence to Mr C arind and this was\njust before the the policy was actually\nimplemented Ed herein came in the\nsuggestion of changing the profit margin\nthe profit margin was changed from 5% to\n12% and the difference amount the\ndifference amount is what the\nenforcement director says are the\nKickbacks that were allegedly received\nby the amadm party these are few details\nthat are likely to be produced before\nthe court tomorrow when Arvin krial is\nproduced before the\ncourt okay viewers as we end with these\npictures now and I'll take a break we're\ntracking this I would like to end by\njust taking you back exactly 10 years to\nJanuary\n2014 so it was 10 years and 2 months ago\nit was close to midnight like it is\ntonight and the difference is that at\nthat time Arin krial then about 47 years\nold seemed to be a young emerging leader\n10 years\nuh he was camping and sleeping outside\nrail B it was a winter day and he was\ncamping outside rail B he said the\nCongress is corrupt there has to be a\nroll back of the policy of the Congress\nL UPA and he said I'm doing this on\nbehalf of the\npeople 10 years later same arind krial\nis\narrested he didn't sign the arrest\nmemo it's a democratically enabled\nprocess\nand he's been caught in a case in which\nhe owes the people and the courts of law\nan explanation so today before you\nviewers there are three Arin krial the\nfirst Arin krial peush I'll tell you\nfrankly told me peush are you hearing me\nthe first arind\nkrial told me that he will never enter\npolitics he came to my studio swore by\nhis family and said I will never enter\npolitics\nthe second K arind krial camped in 2014\nand said the Congress is corrupt I will\nnever do business with\nit and the third Arin krial today is\nwith the Congress in a case in which all\nhis fellow leaders have been\narrested now can he get away by saying I\ndidn't have signing Powers we'll have to\nsee what\nhappens it'll also be interesting to see\nwhat happens to a\nparty and whether the party can survive\nwith out the centralized structure\nfocused around arind krial complex cases\nviewers as arind krial spends the night\nin\ncustody well we'll track the story in\npolitics nothing is impossible I agree I\nagree but the excise policy case a\ncomplex one last word here I think nikel\nwants to come before that Karan who\nhasn't spoken\nKaran you know Arab I remember each one\nof the instances that you pointed out\nand uh it's it's been a sad commentary\non how a man who came about to change\nthe system how low he has stooped today\nhe used to say that people should resign\non moral grounds people should not\nreject Ed and CBI summons his tweets are\ntoday going viral from 10 years back\nthat who are those Shameless politicians\nwho don't show up on Ed and CBI summons\ntoday is one of them he rejected he did\nnot turn up for eight summons and now\nwhen my friend from op says that oh this\nis a threat to democracy this is no\nthreat to to democracy law taking its\nown course nobody is above the law today\nthe chief minister has serious serious\nanswering to do and it's only fair that\nthe Democratic process is rolling out\nthe way it's rolling out in fact it's a\nshame how this man managed to n because\nYou' been after mandates but alas he\ncouldn't handle it because of his own\nconduct so the interesting thing is that\n10 years ago Arin krial anaar and the\nentire India against corruption movement\nwas ask asking for a local bill which\ncame into being and now today there is a\nlocal in the country which we don't hear\nof and the local currently is Justus\nkhilar the same person who had given the\npmla Judgment wherein it wherein the\ncourt had upheld the powers amendment\nthat was made to the pmla which has\nbasically shifted the presumption of\nguilt onto the accused which has made it\nextremely hard for any Court to Grant\nbail in a needy case and by the way for\nyour viewers the selection Committee of\nthe local has the majority of the\ngovernment that's all I have to say by\nthe way I will just correct you Manish\nsodia is\nnot thank you very much I'm not taking\nthis further I'm not taking this further\njustice kilar is a very respected judge\nhe was heading the central Water\nCommission you can't be convenient on\nthings like this we have to understand\nthe stature of the individual we are\nspeaking about before we weigh our words\non this ladies and gentlemen fullframe\npictures arind krial he knows there's a\nlong political battle ahead in politics\nand in life it's not over till it's over\nbut he has a tough road ahead of it and\nhe knows that I'll see you tomorrow good\nnight

yesterday I don't if you\nreferred to that with with the pif\nthere's there's more questions looming\nand um you know I don't think many\nplayers are too privy of of information\nyou know Jay Jay's been trying to be\ntransparent with with emails based on\nyou know what's happening not giving he\nobviously you can't reveal information\nof of of of talks you know that are\nongoing to the

restaurant and when I\nsaw him I went to his table to say hello\nto him because I know that he's you know\na big Legend in in in football in in\nEnglish football as well so I'm just you\nknow uh just say hi to him and and I\nthink some people was at him as well so\nhe just told me that I have to keep\ngoing having a good season and uh he\ntold me I was a good footballer so I\nthink uh you know it's it's a big\ncompliment coming from such a big player\nlike\nthat\n[Music]\n[Music]\nno\nfrom the Delhi Studios of Republic TV\nit's time for arnab goswami on

as\nI said it is moving exactly in that\ndirection now there are two ways of\nlooking at this one that after his\narrest arind krial supporters will start\na sympathy campaign for\nhim secondly that like hon sain or k\nKavita both of whom have been arrested\nin corruption charges it is unlikely\nthat arind krial will get any Mass\nsupport given two facts one that the\ncharges of liquor gate the corruption\ncharges against him are very serious\nchares of lior the corruption charges\nagainst\nserious I've got news that krial has\nbeen arrested ladies and gentlemen I'm\nbreaking that right now

well by the courts all\nof this Arab enforcement directorate is\na extortion Department of the Bia J\nparty it is not taken seriously by\nanybody except for those who are blind\nbucks of the bhia Jan party so I\nunderstand that there are sympathizers\nof the Ed who think that Arvin krial\nshould have just walked into the Ed\noffice gotten arrested on right on day\none but Arvin krial is an honest leader\nwho will get reprieve from the courts\neventually and he has chosen the\ndifficult part arrested Your Leader has\narrested sir your leader is under arrest\nnow can I complete my point you

there has been a brief\naltercation between the chief minister\nand the enforcement director officers\npretty much what happened uh with chief\nminister Hein too right now because it\nis going to be important that Arvid\nkrial signs that arrest memo the moment\nthat please do\nthis\ninv Ed\nCBI\nM mry or M\nC\nAR\nzafur Islam is joining the debate with\naay marati ladies and gentlemen I'm\nstaying with the shots throughout I'm\nstaying with the shots throughout the a\nlot of security personel can I have the\nshots on the air maximum time of the\nscreen on the shots ladies and

we\nstay with the pictures there what the am\nadmi party has been trying to do ladies\nand gentlemen what you're seeing on the\nground is that they're trying to get\nthousands and thousands and hundreds of\nworkers to the ground to start political\nprotest the challenge at this point of\ntime will be to take arind krial out\nfrom his residence and to the Ed\nheadquarters which is already being\ngiven maximum security So to avoid a\npolitical confrontation things have to\nmove very very fast uh these are\npressure tactics obviously the aadmi\nparty is a party mobilized in Delhi they\nwill do everything possible to stop\narind krial from being taken to create\nsome kind of a Law and Order situation\non the ground out there we have the BJP\nfacing off with the op on the debate on\nboth sides of the screen s Zafar Aslam\njoining the debate right now are you\nfearing a Law and Order situation here\nright now with AE marate on the screen\nand ake is this very bad form nine\nsummons you dodge 10 summons you've been\ngiven you refuse to cooperate you tell\nthe Ed you will not cooperate you\ninstruct them on what they should be\ndoing this is after the thrashing that\nyou have got you've got a thrashing in\nthe high court the high court has pulled\nyou up you lost your case there and now\nyou're trying to block the\narrest you trying to block an arrested\nleader a marate from being taken into\ncustody a on the right can respond can I\ncan I respond now anab I think you have\nbeen misinformed that we got a thrashing\nin the high court in the high court the\ncourt asked the enforcement directorate\nto show even one single piece of\nevidence that they have against Mr Arin\nkrial and the Ed was not able to show\neven your interpretation is Holy and\ncompletely incorrect in the high court\ntoday in the high court today you went\nand asked them can I have you on air on\nthe right hand side and and and the\nother guest on the left the debate is on\nnow a marate today in the cour today in\nthe court let me finish let me finish\ntoday in the court you said please\nplease issue instruction\nplease issue instructions one minute I\nam speaking over you because I'm\ncountering you can I just come in please\nokay and in the court today you went and\nsaid you went and said can I have you on\nthe screen I can't see you on the screen\nso I can't take this debate forward\nAditi thank you yeah so the question is\ntoday in the court you went and said\nthat I should not be arrested and the\ncourt said I am giving you no such\nguarantee you demanded you said I should\nnot be arrested the court did not give\nyou any guarantee did you ask for\nprotection from arrest and not get it am\nI right or wrong there can I finish my\npoint now the court said the court asked\nthe enforcement directorate are you\nplanning to arrest do you have any\nevidence against him the Ed said that we\nhave no evidence against him right now\nwe are not planning to\narrest speaking for so long that is can\nI just come in please the court then\nissued a show notice not what asking\nthem for explanation C asked for the Ed\nfor an explanation\nwhy the Ed was supposed to respond by\n22nd April completely mistaken and\ncompletely wrong I don't know who's\ngiving you a low down of the Court you\nwent to the court one minute one minute\none minute one minute one minute can you\nhave three Windows there at the bottom\nscreen today you went to the court one\nsecond one second one just one minute\nfirst ishar is countering you on what\nhappened in the court today I'm saying\nyou lost the case in the court you ref\nyou could not get protection you could\nnot get protection from coercive action\nin\nfact trying to ter for an appearance and\nI said that yesterday as well\nis there is epic misinformation being\nspread your viewers should know what\nhappened in The Honorable High Court\nboth yesterday and today can I make my\npoint if you could lower his because\nthis is absolute misinformation being\nspread if not outright Li what happened\nin the on two days first on the first\nday the court orally observed why can\nyou not appear on the summons because\nyou have received nine summons now today\nthere were two basic prayers before the\ncourt one the summons are illegal which\nthe our party has been saying outside\nthe court the summons are illegal the Ed\ncould not summon the summons should be\nstayed the summon should be quashed the\nsecond aspect was on which they were\nasking the court was interim relief a\nprotection from cores measures in simple\nlanguage a protection from arrest both\nthese requests neither the summons were\nstate that means the Ed had the right to\nsummon him nor was he given any\nprotection from arrest and the third\npart onto what Ed has a good case or not\nEd said during investigation we do not\nshow the case to any accused that's a\nstandard procedure by all investigative\nagencies but the court insisted that you\nshow us the courts the proof whatever\nfiles you have that was seen in the\nchamber after that was seen in the\nchamber The Honorable high court by an\nExpress order declined to give any\nrelief declined to give him a relief of\nprevention absolutely that is absolutely\nf that is a legal how can you not know\nthe LA absolutely false that is\nabsolutely false let me let me respond\nnow let me respond that is absolutely\nfalse that is absolutely false you are\nlying you lying on National\nTelevision can iow me to come now me\ncome\nhave for the last three minutes without\ninterrupting him but you did not let me\nspeak even\nfor respond a marate before that I want\nto update viewers I want to upate\neveryone and I have zafur on the left a\nmarate on the right and zafur zafur I\nwant to just recap the breaking news\nright now uh Delhi chief minister arind\nkrial has been arrested about five\nmobile phones have been seized by the Ed\nall the items have been taken into\ncustody the enforcement directorate\nreached his house after arind krial lost\nthe case earlier today where the Delhi\nHigh Court flatly refused any interim\nprotection from coercive action at this\nstage to krial arind krial had filed an\napplication seeking interim relief in\nhis plea challenging the Ed summons and\nthere was a division bench comprising of\nJustice Suresh Kumar Kat and Justice\nMano Jan uh they gave full Liberty to\nthe enforcement director to file the\nresponse to kajal's application and the\njudge said that at this point of time we\ncannot give him any protection from\narrest uh the Ed reached his house the\nEd told him the joint director told him\nto come to the office kdal said I won't\nkrial said I refused to move the Ed said\nhe's not cooperating the Ed has then\narrested krial krial is right now under\narrest the op says he run the government\nfrom lockup and uh we should be and the\nop has started mobilizing its workers\noutside the house to create some kind of\na physical situation there that is the\nsequence of events now zafur Islam\nNational spokesperson of the BJP former\nRaj uh you heard the spokesperson\nyes see I I heard I heard the ab\nspokesperson I heard the various leaders\nof ab speaking same rhetoric which they\nare speaking for last several days but\nthis will not work anymore ARA because\nhe has to pay for his sins the sins he\nhas committed everyone knows and they no\nauthorities has all the evidences\nproving him that he is a guilty of\ncommitting crime along with the many\nother people involved in liquor scam so\nhe wants to take all the protection from\nthis from the legal protection which he\nis attempting but there is absolutely no\nrelief from high court and he will not\nget any relief from even from supreme\ncourt because I'm saying because of the\ncrime he has committed no matter what\nthe what the spokesperson say no matter\nwhat the leader of other spoke up leader\nsays but the fact is that that he has\ncommitted a crime he has committed a sin\nand he is paying price for that scene\nnow whether he appeals to Supreme Court\nnothing will happen because he every the\nagencies have proof and proof has been\nshown to the high court and that's is\nwhy High Court didn't give him any\nrelief from the arrest which he was\nthinking that he will get protection\nfrom secondly what is more important\nArab that op is trying to somehow create\nLaw and Order situation but let me tell\nyou that no matter whatever they try Law\nand Order situation will be maintained\nas it has to be maintained and they they\nwill not be able to disrupt the Law and\nOrder situation in the state of uh Delhi\nbecause all the merary VES have been\ntaken by the security people by the\nauthorities and these these people may\ntry to disrupt but we will not allow it\nto\nhappen that is more important Point rad\nthat third very important point that he\nwas thinking that he is above the law\nbut today it has been proven if you\ncommit a crime then law has its own way\nhow long Listen to\nEverybody inter that he has committed a\ncrime interruped by not to make a single\npoint throughout the show no you are you\nare interrupting me you have to face my\nquestioning I will certainly question\nyou but it cannot be a oneway street one\nminute one minute it cannot be a oneway\nstreet\none just one minute viewers viewers this\nthis impression this I I I just want to\nto make one point out here that it is\nvery easy for aay marate or pank Sharma\nor Akash deep monei or Mahesh Bala all\nof whom are on air and Mr Bala\nspokesperson of the BRS to come on air\nthat this is wrong that is wrong Etc\nhowever I swear by every word of what\nI'm saying here tonight viewers and I\nknow that you believe me I'll tell you\nwhat has happened today viewers first DD\nsummon 2nd November 2023 arvind krial\ndoesn't go second D summons 22nd\nDecember AR krial third Su thir January\nrefuses summons 18 January\nAR\nFebruary refuses 6 summons 19th February\narinal refuses 7th summons 26th February\narind krial says nothing doing 8th Ed\nsummons 287th February arind krial says\nI will not cooperate 9th Ed summons 17th\nMarch 2024 and Arin krial says I don't\ncare I don't care what you are saying\nyou of the BJP you are a spokesperson of\nthe BJP that's why I don't care what you\nsay what you say does not matter you\nstand with you stand\nwith you don't care for the court you\ndon't care two people on the screen\nplease one minute you don't care for the\ncourt you don't care for the law you\ndon't care for the facts you don't care\nfor the high court and the high court\nhas turned you down you sellout you're a\nsellout of the BJP that's what you are\nyou can say what you want don't believe\nyou a neutral person you can say what\nyou you you can say what you want I will\nsay because you are\nrunning you are going to this way you\nwill only burst an artery and achieve\nnothing one minute one minute one minute\ncan I can I zaf zaf one minute zaf I can\ncompletely understand I can completely\nunderstand I can completely\ntoally I can completely I can I I'm not\ncelebrating I'm reporting it you are you\nthe one was very hot under the\ncompletely understand because to know\nthat your viewers need to know that\nanami is with the BJP and he will\ncelebrate Arin K being arrested but what\nyou will not tell them is two months\nbefore the Loa election an opposition\nleader being arrested like that he's a\ndictatorship your lead AUP you you you\nshould take responsibility for dictator\none minute now if you quiet I will give\nit back to you nice and proper I will\ngive it back to you nice and proper but\nbut but one minute but one minute I\nrequest everyone tonight I no no no no\nno no no Z Za Islam one minute one\nminute one minute one minute one minute\none minute s zaf Islam 1 minute AKA\nmarate has taken it too far and he will\nnow have to listen to me if he's not a\ncoward he will have to listen to me if\nhe is a coward he will interrupt me I\nhave listened listen to him and I'm now\ngoing to give it back to him and unless\nhe's a coward he will listen to me now\nand I'm sure he's not a\ncoward today ladies and gentlemen fact\nis that the court refused to pass an\norder granting interim protection from\narrest to\nkajal and the court said and I quote we\nhave heard both the sides however at\nthis stage we are not inclined to pass\nany order\nexactly this is called a defeat in the\nhigh court exactly and you can cry\nscream call anyone a BJP spokesperson\nbut it is a fact second point the court\nemphasized the court emphasized it's not\nthe BJP the court so you be careful what\nyou say because kajal's lawyer singi had\nsaid today that Ed has filed six charge\nsheets 25,000 documents what is the\npurpose of the summons then the court\nsaid Akay marate and you are probably\nunaware therefore uninitiated you are\nsaying things without knowing the court\nsaid and I quote the words of the Court\nunless arind krial appears please note\nviewers unless arind krial\nappears how will he know what\ninformation documents the Ed ultimately\nwants from\nhim so the court give an instruction\nAkash de that Arin krial must\nappear yes you will attack the court now\nyeah I will attack the court let me let\nme reply a p back uh just I just now\nhe'll attack the court now he'll attack\nthe court listen to no no now he says I\nwill attack the court he'll attack\neverybody today listen to No No he said\nI didn't say the op spokesperson said I\nwill attack the court one minute Akash\nwatch The Words the op National\nspokesperson said I will attack the\ncourt now so attack the court sir I'll\ngive you the fact sir attack the court\nsir I'll give I'll give you spokesperson\nAA marate just said yes I will attack\nthe\ncourt no no right to\ndisagree said nothing when I quoted the\ncourt you saying I disagree with one\nminute I want to put some facts\nhere you to I respect you so much but\ntoday you put out the court proceeding\nselectively sir while substantiate my\nargument today the today The Honorable\nASG who is a lawyer of Ed said in the\ncourt that neither Ami party or Arvin\nkrial is Accused in this matter of\nexcise scam alleged excise scam even\nthat went to the other level where the\ncourt asked enforcement directory to\npresent material evidence against Arvin\nkial to which enforcement direct said in\nthe court that material has is been\ninvestigated so the material not\nsufficing so material has been\ninvestigated cannot be presented in\ncourot quote\nunquote so the evidence was not suffice\nto arrest or to produce in a court of\nlaw against Arvin Kel as per the\nenforcement director lawyer Mr Raju who\nis the additional solicitor general\nthird point that Delhi completely\ncompletely completely said something\ncompletely and\nincorrect oneck enforcement to file that\nreply to Arin K what is the final\njudgment\nby by the high court did he did\nthis is beyond\nmisin I'm not making people pull the\nchairs and sit\nyourself no no no no while everybody\npart will be attacking today we know\nthat in 2018 no no let me ask you one\nquestion let me ask him one question\nforget about the proceeding what is the\nfinal outcome what is the final outcome\ndid he get any protection from the\ndid he get any protection from the court\ndid he get any Rel from the court he\ndidn't get any Rel from the court that's\nwhy he has been\narrested the point is the point is\nAkash let me see if shaan can give me an\ninput can abish and aswara come into the\nstudio like I asked them to come at 9:00\ntoday can they come in please on their\nown walk into the studio please thank\nyou very much and now and now I'm on the\ndebate with I'm making a point here this\nis\npleas now now I'm making a point here\nnow I'm making a point here just one\nminute please just one minute just one\nminute just one minute just one minute\njust one minute\nsee today the high court told arind\nkrial why don't you file an anticipatory\nbail application in the court\nyet okay now the Ed in fact assured the\ncourt Akash deep I don't know to what\nextent you can lie but obviously you\nhave your own limits the court asked the\nEd tell us what evidence you have\nagainst him for arrest is there any\ndocument against krial in response to\nwhich the Ed told the court my Lord we\nhave the\ndocuments and ishkaran says that in\nconfidence the investigating agency\nshared certain documents\nyes yeah so the investigating agency\nshared certain material in confidence\nwith the\nmateri\nisv person under investigation gets to\nhave the investigative agenc documents\nthey don't know the basic law of the\nland no investigative agency at stage of\nInvestigation gives documents to anybody\nwho under the scanner that's the\nLA cover it is given to judges\nthe basic law of the land I do not know\nhow much misinformation they can spread\non National\nTelevision this is\nnot gives\nnot SC does note minute I'm not getting\nthe audio\nclear\nI uh one minute years thise has been on\nForia has been in jail for more than one\nnot a single piece of has been\npresented in the studio I can't hear him\na AE listen to\nme the court asked abishek Manu singi\nwho is kajal's legal representative you\nare a citizens of the country\nthey are giving you summons why don't\nyou appear when you are given the\nsummons what is preventing you from\nattending the\nsummons to which kajal said I'm not\navoiding I need protection from arrest\nbecause I am not a common criminal I\nneed protection from arrest today the\ncourt says I am not going to give you\nprotection from\narrest after which the Ed went to\nquestion kajal and told him to cooperate\nhe did not cooperate after nine summons\nhe has been arrested I think that as\nmuch drama as you may want to do the\nDelhi high court has rebuked kajal's\nlawyer for giving a flimsy excuse of not\nknowing whether the summons are sent for\nkrial as accused or witness the court\nsaid pursuant to the summons if you\nattend the call only then will you get\nto know the Delhi high court has denied\nto entertain kajal's argument that\nsummons are a trap to arrest him please\nunderstand what atii says in our press\nconference that there is no evidence is\nnot the final word the Ed resp you have\nto understand nobody you see that Ed\nwill not arrest a Delhi chief minister\nunless it feels it is sitting on\nsufficient dividence to talk how long\nare you going to speak can I why AR you\nhow long you have made statements today\nwhich are Unworthy of you and I I am\ncompelled to respond to you factually\nwithout descending to your personal diet\ntribe I will not descend to you resp I\nwill not desend to your level I am\ntelling you today that this would not\nhave happened toist no no no

think\nthey'll get the Urgent hearing why\nshould the court give them an urgent\nhearing they might get an urgent why on\nwhat grounds on what on what grounds\nwould the Supreme Court give an urgent\nhearing would he be treated like a vvp\nfor the simple reason there is a Lobby\nor no if there is a Lobby no no one\nminute I don't understand this if there\nis a Lobby abishek does not mean the\nSupreme Court gives an urgent hearing\nwill you I anyone any citizen of the\ncountry get an urgent hearing then why\nthe question being why should Arin krial\nget an urgent hearing when you were\narrested you got an urgent hearing just\nFY no I did not get an urgent hearing I\ndid not get an urgent hearing no you are\nwrong a you are wrong a second time you\nare wrong you are very wrong you are\nabsolutely wrong I went through the\nwhole process I went through all the\ncourts I went through the Sessions Court\nI went to the high court and then I went\nto the Supreme Court you are a liar I\ndid not get an urgent hearing factually\nincorrect you don't know what you're\ntalking about you made multiple mistakes\ntonight you are unprepared for the\ngravity of the situation and you need to\nunderstand this you cannot you cannot\nyou cannot get away anymore and by the\nway and by the way and by the way by the\nway by the way unlike Your Leader even\nwhen param Singh interrogated me I went\nevery time unlike Your Leader I did not\navoid 10\nsum now if you're frustrated\ndesperate\nyou\nmaking hold on don't get desperate like\nthat has been in jail any trial how is\nthat okay how is that a democracy how is\nthat has to be on the left hand side of\nthe screen process a you don't deci\nlegal process is fraud has been\ncompromised by the why can't you put\non\ntheary right now is anybody who is\nagainst the part gets trapped in the\nlegal\nsystem don't know what what discussed\ndon't want to want what been discussed\nonly want to see what was the final\noutcome final outcome was only one thing\nthat he didn't get any relief from the\ncourt that is something which everyone\nshould\nknow he has committed crime court has\nseen all the\ndocuments all the evidence say that\nbased on that he didn't get didn't give\nhim any\nRel something which is important for us\nto know what was discussing the inside\nthe court is something which is not\nrelevant for us to discuss because we do\nnot know everything what happened there\nbut we know the consequences what\nhappened the final outcome so what\nhappened to a what the consequence of a\nwhat was the\nconsequence realize the consequence he\nhas\ncommitted\nwho is aligned with es the law for\neverybody who aligned with the BJP\nescapes jail time and escap the\nlaw La through\nthe he going through the legal\nprocess the BJP there is absolutely law\nfor\neveryone you fail that there is no law\nfor you you above the law\nonly of Delhi who is above the law okay\nShan hasi Shan Shan cut to Shan Shan now\nplease sh with to understand cut live\nwill arind krial Ste down given the fact\nthat he has always taken the position\nthat any corruption\nallegation a person in public life will\nhave to step down are we looking at the\nchief minister of Delhi stepping down\nwith the arrest taken\nwas the chief minister of Delhi is the\nchief minister of Delhi and Will Remain\nthe chief minister suggesting that the\ngovernment of Delhi would be running\nfrom the jail absolutely it will be\nrunning from thar jail because this is\nthe clear modest operandi of the bhartia\nJan party put allegations of corruption\nunder pmla on all opposition leaders\narrest them why do they file cases only\nunder pmla because that is the only act\nin this country under which it is\nvirtually impossible to get bail as a\nsenior leader would agree that there was\nno relief coming in from the court Prim\nofai there was evidence against your\nother leaders the then deputy chief\nminister how is it you saying there's no\nevidence absolutely where is the\nproceeds of crime can the Ed after 2\nyears say they have recovered even one\nrupe from any am admy party leader they\ncan't where is the evidence where is the\nproceeds of crime they have not been\nable to show any proceeds of crime\ndespite having hundreds of officers\ninvestigate the case thousands of raids\nand the timing of the arrest makes it\nvery clear tell me someone as a senior\nas a senior leader as an IRS officer\nhimself Mr krial says that tell me\nwhether am I a suspect or a witness is\nthat even a logical explanation it's a\nlogical question because the fact of\nunder the I'm asking only under the\nsection 50 under Section 17 of the pmla\nact it is the prerogative\nagents question for you why is it\nall\nagainst opposition leaders that's a\nquestion that you should ask the\nenforcement director yes absolutely the\nsecond question why is it that all\nagainst the opposition leaders do not\nhappen under the crpc ACT they do not\nhappen under the prevention of\ncorruption act the only one act in which\ncases get\nfired but there is a corruption Case by\nthe Central Bureau of Investigation\nprecisely because that is the only law\nin the country it was the law was put in\nplace to prevent terrorism to prevent\ntrading of narcotics today but it's also\nmoney whether shaan can you ask her\nwhether she thinks vij and is innocent\ncan shaan hear\nme well well can you hear me one of the\nfact is that right now party\nleaders you know I unfortunately I know\nbecause she's already stepped out\nbecause right now if if I can just show\nyou what's really happening on the other\nside is uh right now most of the Amad\nParty leaders have come on the road\nthat's the current situation reason why\nWonder speed coming in ad if it is\ncoming we'll cut to it is it coming in\nright now one sec I was just told that\nsamit patra's feed is also coming in\nwe're seeing live BJP reactions coming\nin can we cut to that please can we cut\nto it immediately please thank you very\nmuch moving ahead on the story thank you\nlet's hear the reactions viewers idea\nthe idea of corruption the idea of\nminting money through a I would say\nthrough excise policy I mean this is\nunheard of louder a CM a CM who talks\nabout education louder in the\nstudio\nLadi gentl m is\nspokesperson ad please cut out uh Mahesh\nBala is spokesperson of the BRS Mr Bala\ntoday arind krial was confronted by some\nstatements we are told now we are also\ntold that the joint director of the\nenforcement directorate who went there\nto question and then arrest arind krial\nis the same officer I think Raj who\narrested K Kavita so is it possible that\nyour leader K Kavita has made certain\nstatements about the role of arind\nkrial because things have moov very fast\nafter kavita's\narrest no I think this is not from the\nlast arrest of Kavita G because this\ncase is going on Investigation is going\non for the last two years but we need to\nlook at the timing and how it is\nmotivated it's a it's elections are\ncoming in the next month and probably in\nthe month of April and May but you know\nthe arrest took place of kav G and Arin\nkrial G now why why they took the last\ntwo years even to investigate and arrest\nbut and other thing we need to question\nis but is are there any cases on the BJP\nleaders or even the NDA leaders it's\nonly the Ed is investigating only the\nopposition's leaders see like the all\nthese Ed pmla cases are filed and\ninvestigated and arrested all the oppos\no leaders only that's what like the\nIndia Mr Bala all the all the all the\nall the as you are aware all the all the\nopposition leaders went together to the\nSupreme Court and says we are being\ncollectively targeted the Supreme Court\nsaid this has no basis and sent you back\nthe Supreme Court said these are\npolitical matters you can't bring them\nin the area of the Court they are not\nlegally tenable arguments so the Supreme\nCourt has already dismissed that you\nknow that argument of victimization now\nwe need to go by what the courts are\nsaying pankaj this I don't think this is\ngoing to lead to any Mass sympathy\ncampaign it already doesn't seem to me I\nmean the op was expecting that people\nwill be out on the streets protesting\nmorning day and night it doesn't seem to\nbe\nhappening see the Crux of the matter is\nthat too much of anything could could\ndestroy sorrow laughs excessive Weeps\nlet me tell you arrest of kajal is going\nto Boom rank politically very badly on\nBJP don't say thatal is not going to get\nany sympathy out of this he will for\nmany years and especially for a few last\nmonths the entire nation is debating the\nissue of selective treatment by the\ninvestigative agencies of Modi\ngovernment it is charitable attitude\ntowards the leaders of the ruling\ndispensation and its bullying approach\nbullying approach towards opposition\nleaders is the actual cause of concern\nwhy two sets of execution methodologies\nfor the similar laws people are asking\nthis and it has become so obvious in\nlast 10 years of Modi regime that you\nask any commoner on the streets on 30th\nOctober\n2023 on 30th October 2023\nPanki on 30th October\n2023 uh the Court Supreme Court said we\nwill not give bail to Manish\nsodia and the am admi party was shocked\nam admi party before that and I want to\ngo back to this abishek say zafur Islam\nand AK are on the debate cour also said\nthere is a money Trail the Supreme Court\nsaid there is a money Trail the Supreme\nCourt said that a money trail of not 1\nCR 2 CR 30 3 CR but\n338 crores has been tentatively\nestablished that is not true I do not\nunderstand after that how any am admy\nparty spokesperson can come and say that\nthe courts are with us the law is with\nus in fact can the Supreme Court had\nmade the fact that the money trail of\n338 crores was tentatively established\nthe basis for denying the bail of the\nformer deputy chief minister of Delhi m\nsodia it's as clear as that these are\nthe words of the court and they also\nsaid the new yes so AE are these the\nwords of the court or not you just\nrespond with saying yes or no then you\ncan say what you want this ispr cour is\nthis what the Supreme Court said or\nnot is this no no no no no no no you\ncan't avoid the question anymore is this\nwhat the Supreme Court said no you can't\navoid the\nquestion no I asking you and don't do\nwith me please I calling you up I will\nnot descend to your level please please\ndo not please do not I'm showing you\nrespect don't try to go too familiar\nwith me speaking to a senior journalist\nyou don't cross the line you let me\nspeak yeah but it doesn't matter man\nwhatever you say I'm still calling you\nI'm calling you out respectfully what do\nI do with your respect what do I do with\nI don't care what you do one minute one\nminute I don't care what you do I am\nasking you a question is that what the\ncourt said is that what the court said\nlet me speak you let me speak is that\nwhat the court said let let me speak is\nthis what the court\nsaid the 338 money Trail did the Supreme\nCourt refer to the 338 money Trail or\nnot they or they is I enough is\nit did the Supreme Court mention so he\nsay he can't answer the question that is\nprecisely the problem out here the\nsimple question being if you are asked\nwas there a 338 CR money Trail you don't\nwant to answer the question but Akash\nthere's no running away from\nthat this is the fundamental question\nyou'll be asked in the courts of public\nopinion\nalso see no no one minute let Akash take\nthat yeah yeah I I'll answer the\nquestion you are right that The\nHonorable Court said that whatever the\nprofits made in this policy that will be\nconsidered as proceeds of crime that is\nthat CES to three 31 CR I acknowledge\nthat but the profits made by it was by\nthe companies not by the there was no\nmoney Trail to Manish isia sanj Singh or\neven arind kaj till now there is\notherwise Ed would have with the tax of\nmoney now Z Islam please don't Heckle\nplease don't Heckle please let me speak\nsir please now now one of the most\nimportant factor I want to tell today is\nthat normally today while all of us are\ntalking about krial being arrested sanj\ns who was named as terrorist by up\npolice in 2018 joined B J party so\nterrorist only\nall I'm trying to tell you that no no\nall I'm trying to tell you that you how\ncome you are giving him a certificate\nhow come you are giving him a\ncertificate when court has not given the\ncertificate how how can you give the\ncertificate court has enough evidence\nagencies have enough evidence against\nhim there money there's enough evidence\nagainst him the all the proceeds of has\ngone to him he is the\nbenefici not he the only beneficiary the\ndeputy chief minister is also the\nbeneficiary we will respond to that\nseparately all we need to discuss about\ndiscuss separately right\nwe accept accepted proceed The Pride\nthrough un practice unfair practices are\nnot tell me why no no no I'm asking you\nabout K why are you trying to digress\nI'm not trying to digress we will have a\ndebate separately we discuss everything\nabout it but why are you trying to\ndigress I'm asking a direct question did\nhe get did he get any relief from the\ncourt no did he get any relief from the\ncourt or not no he didn't get any relief\nwhy because there's enough\nyou must understand what would have\ngiven definitely some relief and he\nwould have been given protection from\nthe arrest since he did get the\nprotection definitely mean meaning that\nthere is enough evidence against him\nlike there is enough\nevidence the way the case is likely to\ngo the way the case is likely to go one\nminute one minute the way the case is\nlikely to go viewers people are asking\nwhat will happen next abishek you see\nnow that it is a question of a sitting\nchief minister who has been\narrested I don't think the agencies can\nafford to takeing chief minister is\narrested H resigned H Shen resigned so\nin his case he's a sitting chief\nminister technically who is arrested\nthen the court therefore has to the\nagency has to prove that krial has\nviolated the prevention of moneya\nlaundering act so obviously they would\nhave had to force a Money Trade see it's\nnot the CBI which has arrested\nhim are you sure here that the agent CBI\ncase also there's a CBI case but the Ed\nhas chosen to arrest him which means\nthat it's an act of finality by the EDI\nyes so they cannot take a risk of\narresting a sitting chief minister\nwithout and facing the embarrassment yes\nwithout in the court of being pulled up\nby the court saying that you do not have\nreasons to arrest him yes so would they\ntake that that risk they would not I\nmean and look at the kind of stance\nSupreme Court has taken over the last\ncouple of weeks or they've been very\ntough and uh there is no Indulgence\nwhatsoever with whatever position the\ngovernment takes so obviously agencies\nlike the enforcement directorate in CBI\nwhich are uh under attack from the\nposition they would not take any chance\nwhatsoever in so far as documents\nevidence and collation of data is\nconcerned correct correct so I I believe\nand all those people who are attacking\nthese agencies on the panel also would\nunderstand that when everything is\nhappening under such a glare lens of\nmedia and Court scrutiny the agencies\nwould be very cautious and conscious of\nthe fact that their work is under great\nscrutiny and today they shared their\nwork with the honorable Judge today the\nEd showed every document they have all\nproofs they have mail Trail money Trail\neverything to the to the to the high\ncourt judge and then let judge\nwhether you want to give protection or\nnot the judge did not give protection\nwhy\nare so so fundamentally I think I'll\ntake a break at this point viewers uh\nwhen I come back I'm going to go live\nbecause Arin krial has been arrested but\nmy last information is on the ground\nthat he has not been physically taken to\nhis residence yet now how do I look at\nit viewers the liquor gate scam is under\ninvestigation these are pictures here\nlet's hear the Ambient\nsound okay these\nare I'm not getting audio here in\nthe okay so so so so ladies and\ngentlemen Manish Soria who is one of the\naccused in the Delhi lior gate scam case\nformer deputy chief minister of Delhi he\nhas also got multiple criminal charges\nslapped on him by the CBI what I'm\ntrying to say is this is not just a pmla\ncase this is not just a Ed Case this is\nalso a criminal case under investigation\nunder IPC section 20b so there are\nserious charges out here uh there is no\ndoubt that there was a liquor scam the\nonly difficulty for the agencies will be\nthat arind krial so far as I know has\nnot had signing Authority on any of\nthese cases so you know the people\nwho've been signing off on the files\nhave been Manish sodia and others\nhowever is there something else which\ncan be established which corroborates\nhis role viers krial arrested I'm back\nin a few\nminutes lha elections are just round the\ncorner and if you are someone who is\nwondering how postal ballots work then\nthis video is for\nyou\nfirstly let's understand a concept\ncalled postal voting postal voting also\nknown as absentee voting is a method of\nvoting in which electors cast their\nballots by mail rather than person at a\npolling station postal ballots offer a\nconvenient and secure way to cast your\nvote without having to leave your home\nhowever not everyone is eligible to\napply for postal voting there is a\nparticular Criterion that you have to\ntick before you can register\nyourselfs so let us show you what is the\nmagnitude by which we are doing these\nelections\nwe have 997 CR registered\nvoters more than the combined voters of\nuh a few continents put together America\nEurope Australia all many put together\nover 10.5 lak polling\nstations\nand 1.5 polling officials and security\nofficials conduct those elections more\nthan 55 lakh EVMS 4 lakh vles\nele to\nthe\nEl commission Legacy 16 presidential\nelections 16 vice presidential elections\na truly gold\nstandard it's a gold standard in the\nentire election\nmanagement the postal ballot method is\nparticularly used for those individuals\nwho are unable to vote in person due to\nvarious reasons such is being engaged in\nessential services on Election Day the\neligibility criteria for postal ballots\nvary depending on the specific election\nand jurisdiction however some common\ncategories of eligible voters\n[Music]\ninclude members of the Armed Forces\nparamilitary forces and other government\nemployees deployed on Election Duty far\nfrom their home constituencies\ngovernment officials and polling staff\nwho are assigned duties at polling\nstations other than their own media\npersons on Election Duty who are\ncarrying authorized letters from the\nelection commission can cast their votes\nvia postal ballots four are essential\nworkers those employed in essential\nservices like metros Railways Healthcare\nare eligible to vote via postal ballots\nin the loksabha and four State Assembly\nelections besides state police Personnel\non Election Duty for calling personnel\nand Embassy staff on postings abroad can\nalso use this facility to apply for a\npostal ballot eligible voters must\nsubmit an application to the returning\nofficer of their respective constituency\nthe application form typically requires\npersonal details water identification\ninformation and the reason for seeking a\npostal ballot the RO verifies the\neligibility of the applicant and issues\nthe postal ballot if the criteria are\nmet the the process of postal voting is\nquite simple but at the same time\nsensitive too as all the procedures must\nbe followed with utmost care once the\napplication is approved the RO sends the\npostal ballot to the voter's registered\naddress the ballot package typically\nincludes the ballot paper a declaration\nform a secrecy sleeve and a prepaid\nreturn envelope the voter marks their\npreferred candidate on the ballot paper\nin the secrecy sleeve to ensure\nconfidentiality the water completes the\ndeclaration form providing their\nsignature and other relevant details\nlater on the voter fixes the postage\nstamp provided and mails the return\nenvelope to the designated address\nwithin the specific time various steps\nare taken to ensure fairness and\nintegrity of postal voting and various\nsafeguarding methods that are\nimplemented that include strict\neligibility criteria and an application\nprocess clear guidelines for marking and\nreturning postal ballots and scrutiny of\npostal ballots to identify and reject\ninvalid\nvotes postal ballots offer a

and\nSikkim will also be held during the same\nperiod so are you eligible to cast your\nvote through postal ballot let us know\nin the comments\n[Music]\nbelow manest\nUnited\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nfor\n[Music]\nlet's straight away go and have a\nconversation with gulen L ofin limited\nand understand and how are we looking at\nthe textile industry specifically in\nGujarat and elsewhere in the country\nthank you so much sir for joining us\nhere on Republic TV uh first up if I\ncould speak to you about your sector and\ntalk to you about textile and talk to\nyou about where we are today in the\nsector and\nspecifically\nfrom the Delhi Studios of Republic TV\nit's time for Arab goswami on the\n[Music]\ndebate\n[Music]\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen to the\ndebate and now it's time for the\nnation's sharpest opinion the big story\ntoday is that arind krial has been\narrested now I followed arind kajal's\ncareer extremely closely for the longest\nperiod of time in fact at some point of\ntime people said that I was responsible\nfor providing sort of media support for\nthe am admi party's predecessor which\nwas India against corruption and I\nalways held the view that we were not\nsupporting an individual we were at that\npoint of time supporting a cause viewers\nI clearly remember at that time Arin\nkrial came into my Studios and promised\nto me that he would never join politics\nso Arin krial is known to change his\nposition and nobody knows that more than\nme however today he's in a vulnerable\nposition what is my reading of the\nsituation what I would like to tell you\non the nation's sharpest opinion this\nevening dear viewers and if you look at\nthe situation very very logically is\nthat it's absolutely an allout case now\neither arind krial gets fully exonerated\nin which case it's going to be supremely\nembarrassing for the BJP or arind krial\ngets convicted in which case it is going\nto be the very end of his political\ncareer there is no Halfway House in\ncases like this this and therefore arind\nkrial knows that the BJP knows that the\ncentral government knows that now if\narind krial after being arrested gets\nthe support of the courts the courts say\nthere is no case\n[Music]\nno it'll be a body blow for the central\ngovernment before the general election\nand I think knowing all of these\nvariables there would have been some\nvery cool political calculation done by\nthe central government that if it is\ngoing in for the arrest of Arin\nit better have enough information to\nback up and build a case against him now\non the other side Arin kajal's entire\npolitical career has been built not on\nthe freebies which he started giving\nwhen he was chief minister it has been\nbuilt fundamentally on his initial\npositioning as an anti-corruption\nCrusader whether he was in reality one\nor not we can't argue about it some\npeople say it's arguable but the fact is\nthat when he started his political\ncareer he was seen to be one of the\nfollowers of anah haare and it was the\nanti-corruption campaign a lot viewers a\nlot has changed since the spring of 2011\nand the spring of\n2024 in these 13 years arind krial has\nbecome an absolutely hardened\npolitician Arin krial knows that it's\nall out Arin krial has made fundamental\nmistakes he has used taxpayers money to\nbuild himself an extremely expensive\nhome and things like that which are not\ngood for public perception but he's also\nbeen extremely careful on no document or\ngovernment policy has he ever taken his\nown signature which means he has always\ntried to look at the long-term political\ncareer that he has ahead of him and uh\ntry and wait what works for him what\ndoes not work for him and try and if\nrequired put the blame on his colleagues\nwhether it be Manish Soria whether it be\nsatendra Jen but made sure that none of\nthat ttin ever comes back to him so\nviewers also tonight another point to\nmake is that the congress party is in a\nspot\nbecause this is the very Congress that\nhas said that the entire krial\ngovernment the entire kajal cabinet is\nimmersed in corruption and when did they\nsay that they said that in 2023 and as\nan icing on the cake the congress party\nsaid the chief minister should be\narrested for corruption I would like to\nremind the viewers tonight that it'll be\nvery difficult for the congress party to\ndo what it has to do after this because\nthe congress party had said that because\nof liquor gate arind krial is drenched\nin corruption and arind krial should be\narrested in liquor gate this was till a\nfew months back 2023 arind krial\npretended to be the beacon of the anti\nvvip racism he was against the lbti but\nladies and gentlemen this is the same\nkrial is doing in his own source viewers\ntherefore some people would say it is\ntime for the mask of morality or rather\nimmorality of Arin krial to come off it\nis time for the people to see his real\nface out here the very people who\nbelieved in his story of being the arm\nadmy with having the strong values of\nthe middle class will now Define his\nfuture so viewers these are some very\nyou know clear questions that emerge out\nof the situation tonight let me go first\nto shaan to get a sense of what's\nhappening shaan it's been a long time\nit's been a long time how many people\nhave turned up outside kajal's house and\nwhy is he not being taken out\nyet and what's what's going to happen\nnow that he's been\narrested\nwell\nwell in fact the arrest memo has already\nbeen served in fact the grounds of\narrest has already been read out to the\nChief Minister the reason for the delay\nthat we are seeing right now is because\nof a Law and Order situation uh that is\nbasically developing outside the chief\nMinister's resident I'll just quickly\nshow you uh these are the images of\nsenior aadmi party leaders who are out\non the road right now you have aishi\nhere and several of the other aadmi\nparty leaders now this as you can see\nright now know this entire area has been\ncompletely blocked because of short\nwhile back you've had senior Amad party\nleaders blocking this road not allowing\nany movement to take place so you have\nhad the rapid action force that has been\nbrought in on both sides so on the other\nside it's on the other side is where the\nchief Minister's residence is that area\nhas been completely uh barricaded we're\nexpecting that to happen in a short\nwhile from now meanwhile there has been\nan additional deployment that has been\nbrought in uh that to at the Enforcement\ndirectorate's office so in a short while\nfrom now it's expected that he'll be be\ntaken out that's where a medical\nexamination will also take place but yes\nthere is a Law and Order situation\nbuilding outside the chief Minister's\nresidence okay shaan is there abish know\nyou mentioned about the fact that krial\ncut his teeth into politics with with\nanti vvip movement but look at what's\nhappening really almost 5 to 7 kilm jams\nis what we are getting to understand\nshaan was just mentioning about the law\nand daughter situation people are coming\nout blocking roads and obviously this is\nbeing mobilized and orchestrated so this\nis not following the letter and spirit\nof the law this is trying to Hoodwink\nmanipulate Etc in terms of when you're\nfacing the law also also the fact that\nyou were mentioning about arind krial\nnot signing any document now there is\nthis section in IPC now the BNS would\nhave a different number uh in the bhan N\nSita uh section 33 read along with\nsection 120b of the IPC which is\nconspiracy taken together with common\nintention and common objective then you\ndon't need a signature because if you're\npart of a conspiracy there is common\nintent if something is proved for one it\nproves for everyone involved in the\nconspiracy right so I think so I think\nthat that bit that bit of homework\nobviously the agencies would have done\nso the whole attempt here awara has been\nto try and project arind krial as the\nring\nMaster what they call loely the Kingpin\nKingpin the Kingpin of the scam uh the\nthe am admi party says that you you this\nis a positioning you've created but you\ndon't have concrete evidence against\nkajal yet what's the inner thinking in\ngovernment circles within the Ed within\nthe BJP that you're hearing it's very\nclear as far as BJP is concerned BJP\nsays let the agencies decide and today\nthe agencies because the allegation\nwhich the amadm party levels onto the\nagency that they work on the behalfs of\nthe government that is the BJP so today\nthe agency gave all the documents all\nthe proofs they had to the judge and\nallowed what do you mean all the proof\nthey presented the complete file against\nkrial and not only krial the whole mail\nTrail the whole line of connection\nbetween Samir mahindu Vijay ner all the\npeople who are involved in this liers\nscam and confidential information was\nshared with the high court with with the\nDelhi high court judge today and then he\nwas told sir there is only one request\nplease don't share it with anyone else\nand now you decide should protection\nbeen given should protection be given\nforget there are approv\nthere\nappr we are still not questioning the\nBRS leader said no there is no\nconnection the day after K kav was was\narrested or now for the first time krial\nwas made a co-conspirator with an amount\nof 100 CR being mentioned by\nEd true so uh I'd like to go across to\nsidhart who's on the debate right now\nsidhart Sharma of the am admi party and\npratus Kant of the BJP is with us uh we\nhave with us subasa I see her on the\nscreen uh\nnow a point being made here sadhart I\ncan see I I appreciate the fact that you\nare smiling you have a smiling face\ntonight your other colleague was so\nangry almost exploded on the show aay\nmarate but you are a man with more\nexperience uh however the the the the\nspecific point tonight it's it's futile\nto ask you for your reaction because I\nknow what your reaction will be the\nspecific point we are coming to tonight\nwith you sidhart is that uh the court\nwas was given a\nfile and pratus please pay attention to\nthis the the government was very keen to\nwin the case to make sure that Arin\nkrial does not get any protection from\narrest so the government went all out\nand through additional solicitor general\nSV\nRaju it placed I am told a full\nconfidential envelope and file before\nthe honorable Judge and said milords\nhere is the information on the basis of\nwhich we have to interrogate him take\naction against him him being arind krial\nbut the court was also requested by the\nagency that this is highly confidential\nand very explosive information regarding\nMr\nkrial and I am sharing this with you in\nconfidence and please do not stop us\nfrom arresting him if necessary The\nHonorable High Court saw the file\nsidhar and after seeing the file said\nyou have to cooperate and I'm not going\nto give you any protection from\narrest so obviously there is some\ninformation which has been shared with\nthe\ncourts some very sensitive\nfacts some astonishing details perhaps\nhave been shared by the courts with the\ncourts so sidat this is going through\nlegal process\nyeah it's not aish anymore it's a very\nstraightforward accurate legal process\nyes uh let me at the very outset tell\nyou that uh\nuh hundreds of nearly 100 years ago we\nalso saw that when paced with a Bradman\nthe England cricket team led by Douglas\nJardine resorted to Bodyline bowling now\nit was for the people to judge whether\nthat was right or wrong that was that\nwas one of the reasons why I was smiling\nthis is in politics as in sports uh you\nyou compete you compete everything\nbecomes fair in war and politics anyway\nI'll come to the very specific points\nthe legal jargon that you were speaking\nto and I think the viewers of Republic\nTV also have a right to know what\nhappened today in the courts I'll be\nvery succinct it'll be very crisp hardly\n10 sentences within 10 sentences I end\nuh today what happened was arind krial\nchallenged Ed notices to him the court\ngave Ed April 22nd to respond uh if if\nearlier as you said the the the court\nwas apprised of some sensitive\ninformation the court would have said\nasked Arin krial to get arrested forth\nwith or or cooperate with the Ed forth\nwith it did not do so it the court gave\nEd 22nd April to respond the Ed had\nearlier in its own press release has\nnamed arind grial as the top leader of\namadm party but paradoxically in court\ntoday the Ed said that it has neither\nnamed him named him as an accused nor\nwants to question him as an Amad party\nleader now going further the Ed also\nsaid that it can arrest anybody any time\nbut it had not done so till that time\nnow what these things make clear it is\nnow clear that there is no no money\nTrail found either with arind krial as a\nperson or as an accused now Ed had two\noptions today after that either respect\nlaw and convince the court on April 22nd\nthat Arin k was some kind of beneficiary\nor the Ed had an option to respect the\nBJP and arrest a constitutional figure\nwho was neither an accused nor a\nbeneficiary in Ed's own admission now\nthis was a catch 22 situation for for\nBJP it had to arrest arind krial knowing\nfully well that it is doing so at its\nown Peril and confessing to its Panic\nthat it does not have answer to Arin\nkajal's model of governance it is as\nsimple as that every even a lay man\ntoday knows that that sub judice matters\ncan't be acted upon still BJP going\nahead means BJP is so spooked by am admy\nparty that it can go from illegal to\nblatant acts to stop arind krial it is\nnow crystal clear that after getting\ncaught pant down today incidentally what\nhad happened today was at 5:00 the\nelection commission had also put on on\nits website the 8,250 CR illegal money\nthat BJP had so BJP had go his illegal\nfunds that public a desperately BJP\nneeded a headline change and I think\nthat is what they are trying to do now\nas far as amadm party is concerned arind\nkrial is a model of governance that\nmodel of governance got acceptance not\njust in Delhi but Punjab also I think\nthat you are one minute uh uh uh one\nminute uh can I can I can I can I stop\nyou right there sir absolutely see what\nhappens is sure what happens what\nhappens is that I I think that we must\nremain keep our Focus\nand my focus is on the legal case that\nhas to be there or not there against Mr\nkrial before that once let me go across\nto Deepak shaan is there of course\nDeepak if you can hear me what's your\nlocation what's happening around you\nright now what are you hearing about\nwhen Mr krial may be brought out and why\nis it taking so much\ntime right anab uh I'm currently outside\nuh the Ed headquarters and behind me if\nI could ask my uh video journalist to\npan and show you these are the\nbarricades that have been set up outside\nthe Ed headquarters heavy security\ndeployment has also been put in place at\nthe Ed office and Beyond these\nbarricades that's where Arin kial will\nbe taken and further questioning will be\ndone and what we are also getting to\nunderstand here is that four companies\nof paramilitary force as well as 100\npolice Delhi police force have been\ndeployed across the national capital all\nthe roads leading from the Delhi Chief\nMinister's residence till the Ed office\nuh the entire route has been jam-packed\nand uh the police deployment is also\nhigh in the roads leading up to the Ed\nheadquarters so what we are given to\nunderstand is that shortly Arin krial\nwill be brought to the Ed headquarters\nwhere rml Health officials will carry\nout his medical examination similar uh\nsituation as to what happened with\nSanjai Singh and satender Jane as well\nso similar process will be followed\nfirst Arin krial will be brought to uh\nthe Ed headquarters after which a\nmedical examination will happen rml\nHealth officials will also reach the Ed\nheadquarters four companies of\nparamilitary forces and also 100 police\nDelhi police have been deployed and if I\ncould show you the route leading up to\nuh the Enforcement directorate's office\nuh Delhi police uh you know convoys have\nbeen rallying up and down this road to\nuh to detect any sort of untoward\nincident and it is also expected that a\nlarge number of Am admi Party leaders\nwill also arrive at the enforcement\ndirectorates headquarters right here and\nin of uh thank you thank you deep thank\nyou thank you deep Deepak the the there\nis a there is another question here\nnow pratus the am admi party says arind\nkrial will be chief minister from thar\njail or from custody is this tenable is\nthis possible can you have the chief\nminister of Delhi run his office from\njail I mean there has to be some\nreasonableness to suggestions now pratus\nwhat's your take on\nthat well whatever krial does doesn't\nshock me his thought process AR I really\nwatched this man's career very closely\nand I'm so surprised that today when\nhe's going to jail I was just\nremembering that his whole politics is\nbased on lies sitting in Delhi he's\ntrying to run Punjab basically he was a\nKingpin to corruption everywhere either\nyou look at Water\nB infrastructure projects there was not\na single place where he and his people\ndidn't want to make money including the\nShish Mel which he made where he lives\neven there the\ncontractors given money I mean the a\nwhole Saga of scams which this man was\nheading all through and today when he\ngoes to jail and I was listening to the\nop uh spokesperson and I realized that\nhe missed a\npoint the arm admy party went to the\nlower court where they saw the paper\nthey didn't listen to him they went to\nhigh court they went to double bench\nthey went to the epex court the single\njudge said they a clear trail of 300\nplease don't disturb my time go to the\nlower court and come to us again even\ntomorrow he'll get arrested he'll go to\nSupreme Court Supreme Court will never\nlisten to them they will say please\nfollow the due procedure which is laid\ndown in this country that you go to the\nright appropriate bench and then you\ncome to us krial was trying to ask the\nEd you send me the questionnaire do it\non video chat tomorrow you'll ask the\njudges your lordship you please give\njudgment and tell me why you have given\nthis judgment do we have this in our\nconstitution is this man above\nConstitution he was trying to run away\nfrom all these summons because he knew\nthat all the roads were leading to his\nhouse and eventually finally today the\npeople of Delhi will be relieved that\nthis corrupt is going to jail and it was\nhigh time he had to be fixed because Del\nhas really 10\nyears we have a developing story we have\na developing story uh awara wants to\ncome on it the Delhi LG is to sub report\nsubmit a report to the m absolutely\nthere is a huge issue about whether you\ncan be chief minister uh from prison no\nthe law what's the latest on that\nabsolutely at this point of time keeping\nin mind that there is a special status\nof Delhi keeping in mind that the law in\nplace what we are being told by our\nsources that a chief minister cannot be\nin prison and run the government this\nwill hamper the process and in that case\ntechnicality there there's a jail manual\na jail manual there is a jail manual or\nnot happen for the\ntime what is so the jail manual Clearly\nsay camera two please yeah thank you\nyeah jail manual clearly says that there\nis no provision under which a minister\ncan work from inside the jail a minister\nor a chief minister also a minister so\nthe the jail the jail manual in in case\nof thar jail I'm being told is very\nclear that is jail specific or all jail\nman I'm getting to know\nfrom has already sources are clearly\ntelling me mha has gotten active mha is\nsaying either he has to be replaced or\nremoved so it is up to the am admi party\nbecause right now there is a whole\nbravado of the amadm party saying aishi\ncomes out s badw comes out you'll have\nthe amadm party spokesperson a also\ncomes out and say that no he will run\nthe from no he cannot the law doesn't\nallow that and in that case if the arm\nadmy party sticks to it then either he\nhas to be suspended a new chief minister\nhas to be swed in or the process will\nfollow tomorrow morning because till now\nthe official as Shan was just saying the\narrest memo is being worked on the\nletter is still not out so the LG will\nbe submitting the report and while you\nspeaking on on just live movement there\nthe Ed vehicles have just gone in inside\nthe vehicles and they will shot

rule sidat sidat you\ncannot defy the rule if the rule says\nthat if the rule says Sadat can you hear\nme if the ru that you cannot be chief\nminister from jail you cannot create new\nrules for\nyourself yeah two things one is that\nDelhi will not be Delhi does not get\nadministered through a diar jail manual\nPoint number two uh in this same India\nthe stalwart like atal bihari vajpai had\nreminded of a Raj Dharma to Mr Narendra\nmod2 but he did he he chose not to\naccept it so right now am admy party is\na political party we have W with a\npeople's mandate we have asked the\npeople of Delhi that arind krial gets\narrested what should be done 95% of the\npeople have overwhelmingly said that we\nhave elected Arin krial to serve us he\ncan serve us from wherever he wants to\nit's as simple as that he\ncan I need I need Shan to be there you\nneed to understand Arin krial is not\nover and above the law may feel so but\nif no minister no arind krial no other\nminister irrespective of party amadm\nparty Congress BJP SP and the man who\ncomes out to defend you today is none\nother but Rahul Gandhi Rahul Rahul\nGandhi is coming out you need to\nunderstand does not all cannot you you\ncannot you cannot superimpose theil\nmanual on the constition of India can\nyou show me the constitution of India\nand say that a chief minister cannot sh\nrunning the chief ministership from X Y\nor Z place can you show me the\nconstitution of India saying so if not\nlet's understand that the law according\nto you is not will not be administered\naccording\ntoh will be administered according to\nthe Constitution of India and if the\nconstitution of India I can explain sir\nunder the constitution of India there is\na provision of delegated legislation\nonce Parliament makes a law and\nAtes oh okay fine under the constitution\nof India there is a provision of\ndelegated legislation the Jade Manuel\ncomes under what is called a delegated\nlegislation and hand it's integral to\nthe constitution of India and so the\nchief minister if he's inside the jail\nhas to follow the jail manual my my my\nmy essential question Here Right Now to\nS will be and S I can understand the\nemotional tenor of what you're saying\ntonight can I have him on the shot and\nnot be on the eight window Aditi thank\nyou I am asking I am ask asking\nsomething to sidat Aditi thank you so\nmuch just one minute sidat just chill\nokay chill now s listen to me absolutely\nit's a is is Manish sodia deputy chief\nminister of Delhi today he is in\njail he's in jail for is he a present\ndeputy chief minister or former deputy\nchief\nminister well if you go back to the\ntimeline you will see that Mr Manish\nhear in the studio fold back\nplease yeah uh I think if you go back to\nthe timeline why was he removed as\ndeputy chief minister why was he removed\nby arind krial as deputy chief minister\nafter he went to\njail two why was he not you chief\nminister not operate as deputy chief\nminister from jail asking me to I've\nheard your question I'm asking you to\nanswer my\nquestion yeah but as a defense you have\nto give me me time to answer if you go\nback to the timeline and see Mr Manish\nzodia was neither removed from the\ndeputy chief ministership immediately\nafter his arrest after a considerable\nperiod of time being the deputy chief\nminister he himself said that he would\nhave he would resign and that is why\nthat action was taken please go back to\nthe timeline and see immediately after\nhis arrest he was not removed as the\ndeputy chief minister after a\nconsiderable amount of time period of\ntime had elapsed Mr Mania himself said\nthat he would like to resign then that\nis why it was accepted it is as simple\nas that go back to the timeline and see\nnow just just just just just just one\npoint sir uh I would like to remind you\nthat the Manish sodia was deputy chief\nminister of Delhi he was arrested and\nthe post of deputy chief minister has\nbeen wakened since the first March of\nlast year however the post of Chief\nMinister cannot be kept\nvacant it is not vacant as of\ntoday Minister may not have auty chief\nminister but has a chief minister it is\nsimple as that you can't break the rules\nfor that you can't break the rules for\nthat simpal provision you\nsecretar you want the officers you want\nthe secretar to\noperate not there it was not there for\nMr Narendra Modi in 2002 when Mr bihari\nvaj reminded him of rajad Dharma so what\ndoes not apply what is good for the\ngoose is good for the gander how come it\nhow come you there is some other rule\nfor BJP and other rule for\nAmad was never arrested of Mind Mr\nNarendra Modi was never arrested there\nis no point\nnumber Mr was never arrested there is no\ncomparison was not arrested when was Mr\nModi arrested how can you draw a\ncomparison to that wasn't he asked by\nthe prime minister of India Mr atel\nbihari to follow\nRaja was he arrested what was he\narrested isn't it isn't it isn't it\nright that Mr nendra Modi was under was\nhe arrested what is that argument no no\nno I mean you have to you have to be\nreasonable at some point of time you\ncan't say anything and get away with it\nyou can't you can you can read a nursery\nline with a lot of force it doesn't make\nyour point right\nwas under incar not according emerging\nsubject of debate can I go back to shaan\nplease Shan is reporting life shaan\nwhat's happening around you\nshaan I go I go straight to shaan I\ndon't have to go to the 11 window\nshaan well in fact this is the last\npoint from where we can report right now\nbecause the rapid action force has been\ndeployed here all the barricading has\nbeen done in a short while from now we\nexp it from the other just I'll just try\nand explain this to you don't from where\nwe are reporting right now that's the\nchief Min this is the chief Minister's\nresidence which have been as you can see\nright now completely locked that's the\nlast point the enforcement director team\nis right inside he will be taken out\nfrom this is the gate right now there\nare a number of armadi Party workers who\nhave all been gathered here and what you\nsee right now on my right hand side is\nthe rapid action for that has been\nbrought in because there is a bit of a\nLaw and Order situation that developed a\nshort while back with the roads on the\nother side from where I was reporting a\nshort while back that was completely\nblocked that's the reason why there has\nbeen a considerable delay right now in\nterms of the arrest formalities that\nhave been that has already been\ncompleted I'm given to understand in a\nshort while from now uh the enforcement\ndirector headquarters where the security\nhas been broughten the arrangements have\nalready been\ndone ARR have already done okay shaan I\nthink we getting a lot of video glitches\non that uh\nthe op is very very adamant that arind\nkrial will remain chief minister and\noperate as chief minister from thar jail\nor wherever he\nis right and they they would like to\nmake a political issue of\nit they all been trained by arind krial\nnever believe a word of what they say\nthey will say something in the morning\nby afternoon they will have a press\nconference and totally deny and by night\nthey will change the whole story there\nis no element of truth whatever they say\nthe rule of the law of the country will\nprevail nobody can run this city of\nDelhi from\njail this man has to resign this man\nwill not get bail because the law is so\nclear the evidence is there look at all\nthose excise scam uh offenders they have\nbeen in jail for ages because the proof\nis so strong the evidence is so strong\nAR\nwho gave you money and you him into appr\nand\nhe is true isn't it true for the\nBJP that\nyoued talking absolutely nonsense but\nstill I had the patience to hear so you\nplease have patience to hear okay just\nhave patience just have\npatience I I never I never interfered in\nwhat you were saying you were talking\nabsolutely nonsense louder louder\ns\nmoney of the crime it is Absolut I was\ntrying to make a point here which this\nman is try to disturb me because he has\nno other story to tell here the question\nis the evidence is so strong against him\nso\nstrong it took time it took time for him\nto get arrested\nbecause man who was noing audio\n[Music]\ngovernance deficit it is as simple as\nthat there is absolutely Noy of money\nhere\nneither neither 100 there is not a\nsingle recovery still you are arresting\npeople you arresting constitutional\nauthorities how come that's on the basis\nof a person becoming an approver and\nthat approval\nduring the\nnot and this is this is only one case\nthe innumerable scams where\ninvestigations are going on eventually\nall of them are going to mature and this\nman for all the corruption he has done\nown\nlikei lrish were arrested they were put\nbehind bars they were under the\nmaintenance of internal Security Act for\nnearly 17 months in jail they did that\nstop it is BJP saying that mrhar\nand\nMr National threat no they were national\nheroes we are also saying national\nheroes so what you do with there is a\nweapon how do you use that weapon you\nhave a nice I think now it is a\npolarized fight between\nideology ideology can I get the guest in\nthe screen on the\nright\npeople that is I am not hearing either\nin the stud vote now whether they\nwant want\nto S calm down s calm down s sidat calm\ndown s listen to me I'm finished today\nyou are fully aware that the case is\nturning and Sanjay Singh has been sanj\nSingh is not running the government in\nDelhi nikel I cannot hear you in the\nstudio at all I don't know what you're\nsaying because I can't hear\nyou calm\ndown uh today s is not running the\ngovernment in Delhi Manish sodia is not\nrunning the government in Delhi satendra\nJen is not running the government in\nDelhi if these three individuals are not\nrunning the government in Delhi because\nthey are from jail sadhar then how can\narind krial run as chief minister from\njail arind krial has denied any of these\nindividuals so that he arind krial has\nsaid that once you go to jail you cannot\nbe in the cabinet then how does that\nsame rule not apply to him this is a\nrule that he brought in he quickly\nremoved his existing ministers and\nbrought in atishi why can't atii be\nchief minister of\nDelhi I while he's in jail when he comes\nout if he's cleared that he can take\nover\nagain what I answered earlier to your\nquestion about the timeline of\nmanister I will not go into repeating\nrepeating it again suffice to say that\nDelhi has a governance model arind krial\nas of now is the chief minister of Delhi\nwhere does the Constitution stop ask Mr\nkrial to run Delhi from X Y or Zed Place\nanybody in the BJP can show it BJP\ncannot show it so let us agree let us\nstop it at that now as far as Public\nImage is concerned as far as politics is\nconcerned am admy party and the people\nof Delhi have overwhelmingly said that\nthey have voted for arind krial to serve\nserve them and they don't really care\nfrom where he serves as long as he\nserves them and that is what AM admy\nparty is doing and that is what has\nspooked BJP to this extent today that\nwith today itself I at the cost of\nrepetition I'll say Arab today itself in\nthe court the the Ed said that arind\nkrial is neither an accused as a person\nnor does it have any nor nor is it\nasking AR who has said all\nthis\naccus leader even Chang within 2 hours\nwas the only thing that changed is he\nhas you you are not arrested you don't\nget what are you saying lawyering to the\ntoday\npleasure that he's not arrested why\nthe because the evidences were so clear\nabout\nhim you are saying something which makes\nno sense is say something which is\nsensible that this debate taking further\nyou are you are trying to create stories\nwhich is not true at all you cannot\nchallenge the Democracy like\nthis your lawyers today begging that\nplease what did the lordship\nsay the story you want the people of\nIndia today in the next two\nmonths nobody nobody\nCongress is join the protest on\nground part you sing now now my question\nto nikil and nikil and subra is n nikil\nnikil and subra on the screen please and\ncan I have the audio in the studio nikil\nthe congress party had said that arind\nkrial should be arrested because he's\nThe Mastermind of corruption in the\nliquor gate\nscam to today the government has done\nwhat the Congress\nwanted this was the very statement of\nthe Congress that the Amad admi part is\nat the center of liquor gate and arind\nkrial is The\nMastermind and arind krial should\ntherefore be\narrested of the audio is not clear I\ncan't hear\nyou Arab may I may I just been informed\nthat the Congress that the congress\nparty is joining the protest so I'm\nreminding everyone yes subra coming to\nyou I'm reminding everyone that it is\nthe congress party which had said that\narind krial should be arrested because\nof liquor gate so please keep that in\nmind when the congress party joins the\nprotest along with the am admi party\ntonight yes\nsubra uh Arab there are two three things\nwhich are very clear Point number one\ntoday arind krial has lost\nany kind of moral High Ground that he\nwas in he should take moral\nresponsibility and he should resign I\nthink I don't want to get into\nlegalities right now but this is what he\nshould do Point number two this country\nhas had a you know that there have been\nprecedence in the past we have seen yua\nG um bharati G Lalu yadav g j Lita G all\nresign they never said I I didn't hear\nthis Narrative of there is emergency in\nthe country that there is politics\nhappening all around people when they\nwere accused when lot of evidences came\nto the\nForefront they fought the entire case\nthey did continue in politics nobody's\nasking Arin krial to resign from\npolitics but the Constitutional post\nthat he has there is a sanctity attached\nto the post and for the different kind\nof politics that he was trying to\nendorse I think he should just take\nmoral responsibility and\nresign also you know uh there are lot of\nthese big talks being made by amadm\nParty leaders let us\nunderstand arind krial I'm talking\nespecially to about the India Alliance\nleaders if these guys are fighting for\nthe Constitution and fighting for the\nrule of law and fighting for different\nthe sanctity of different\ninstitutions\nI don't understand this what are you\ntalking about thatal leaders in a\ncountry have to bow down\nbefore ofct prime minister what are you\ntalking about I'm talking about the fact\nthat when you are\ngiven look at the principal opposition\npart of the country congress party all\nits bank accounts have been frozen J\nchief minister has been put behind bars\ndeputy chief minister of Delhi has been\nbehind bars now the chief minister of\nDelhi is behind bars none of these\npeople have been convicted you're\ntalking about L Prasad L Prasad resigned\nfrom the post when he\nwas speak over me not yet done what you\ndoing right now is putting the entire\nopposition of the country behind bars on\nup charges without any\ndemocracy the country world is looking\nus and you made this country into a\nmockery for the 74 years India has been\na Democratic Republic despite",

you know and\nthereof our immediate\nconcern uh but then external challenges\nalso United Nation we've seen it in\nbalakot sorry balakot we've seen it in\nuh Caril we've seen it in\ngalwan uh if you look at the other side\nof this the eternal security challenges\nactually which actually have furist\nTendencies sometimes they also become\nchallenging we need to look at that\nparticular aspect also as far as the\narmed forces are concerned the major\nchallenges are the rise of China and the\nunsettled boundary probably we have two\nneighbors both adversar to us both of\nthem profess that their friendship is\nhigher than the Himalayas and as deep as\nthe oceans and they are both nuclear\ncapable but over here both of them are\nactually predictable we know that these\nare the kind of\nthreats what is unpredictable and for us\nwould biggest challenge would be the way\nWarfare is changing in the\nfuture uh because of this we'll have to\nintroduce new weapon systems\ntechnologies tactics is going to change\nstrategy is going to change and probably\norganization systems so this particular\npath of how to predict and what to path\nto take right now so that we are at the\nright place at the right time that I\nthink is the biggest challenge for us\nand general uh we live in a very\nuncertain neighborhood as you very\nrightly pointed out sir we have an\nexpansionist Nation on one side we have\na state sponsor of Terror on the other\nplus uh the subers elements within if\nyou were to grade the threat that we\nface as a nation U how would you grade\nthe threat that we Face\nsir I think uh the first part actually I\nwould have answered it uh in the first\nquestion itself you know I think uh the\nrise of China it's a certain nature I\nthink that's the biggest challenge the\nonly silver lining in this is that it\nrise hasn't been so peaceful so it's got\na large number of nations like-minded\nNations United together and hence for\nChinese to achieve their geopolitical\naims actually would be slightly\ndifficult I think that for us would be\nthe biggest challenge I\nfor but as we face this challenge in the\nHimalayas does our geographical location\nalso provide a solution to the\nchallenges that we Face especially going\nahead means I'm a strong proponent of\ngeography it shapes the Strategic\nOutlook of\nNations uh for us the Himalayas have\nbeen providing a security since ages\nactually but off late because of\nadvancement of Technology you can know\nthe Himalayas are no longer impediment\nbecause you have missiles you have\naircrafts and then of course we been\nable to breach it by advancing Mobility\noptions in\nHimalayas so to some extent uh uh the\nimpregnability of Himalayas if I would\nsay has diminished slightly for us but\nthen of course we also have a\ngeographical advantage because of a\npeninsular shape which JS out into the\nIndian Ocean flanked by two Island\nterritories which gives us a lot of\nstrategic depth and uh the exess to\nindan Ocean region is very very\nrestricted and we enjoy a predominant\nposition so I think we need to balance\nout between our Continental challenges\nand Maritime\nchallenges so U if there is a problem in\nthe Himalaya do the solution lies in the\nIndian Ocean uh I won't put it across\nlike that you know if our immediate\nchallenges and problem of course are\nland Centric uh that's because of\nunsettled borders and problems with\nPakistan but if if a nation we have to\ngrow actually uh we may be part of this\nAsian Landmark but actually we can't\ntravel through this Asian Landmark you\nknow we can't travel because China\ncontinues to occupy Tibet and then we\nhave a problem with the pakistanis on\nthe western side if you look East manmar\nis you know embroiled in kind of a\nproblem so if you look India is kind of\nlike an island nation actually and the\nonly way for India to grow is towards\nthe Seas which I just mentioned so our\ndestiny I would normally say lies in a\nseas and there's a way where\nopportunities also lie so my threats may\nbe in the Continental domain but the\nopportunities lie on the\nSeas that's a big Point you're making\nsir tell us more about this dastra that\nIndia has just tested why is the testing\nof the AG 5 the mirv so\nsignificant uh let me say that we have a\nnuclear Doctrine which professes no\nfirst\nuse and I think hence the credibility of\nour deter has to be very very high uh\nthis particular test actually uh says\ntestifies this that you know the\ncredibility of a doctor\nwhen we talked about\nDET you know there's a element of\ncommunication into it that mean we\nshould be able to communicate if you\ndon't communicate to the adversary what\nyou possess then the detes have got no\nvalue so this particular test should is\na part of a\ncommunication so this will strengthen\ndeterence and I believe in the long run\nuh will promote strategic stability in\nthe\nneighborhood but right now I think it's\ntime to congratulate all those people\nwho are involved in the test especially\nd\noh absolutely it it's a big test ag5 U\nsir as we move forward you working very\nextensively on reorganizing our Armed\nForces to face future challenges how is\nthat reorganization coming along um and\nwhat what sometimes gives you perhaps\nsleepless nights on how are we moving\nforward and are we moving forward at the\npace at which we ought to\nyeah uh let me Begin by saying that you\nknow uh change is part of you know it's\nonly constant in life they say and\norganizations who don't change actually\nwill become extend Charles darn said so\nnot me and so that's true for\norganizations and as well as for\norganizations I told you in the\nbeginning actually that the Warfare is\nchanging rather rapidly we got to change\nfor that uh unfortunately for us for the\npast 77 years all the three Services\nhave grown\nindependently uh they have their own\ncapabilities they have developed over\ntime a culture of theirs\nactually uh but now we think actually\nthe multi-domain operations are a\nreality for future and a network Centric\nkind of in Warfare so if we have to do\nthis with all the three services have to\ncombine the capabilities we also need to\ncombine our capabilities not only in the\ncyber space but also in the cognitive\ndomain so it's the reforms what we\nattempting over here is basically uh\ntrying to integrate the three services\npromote kind of a jointness between them\nand jointness is if I would say\nelaborate is something like promoting\nBon homing removing mistrust between the\nthree services unfortunately that\nexisted till some time back and uh this\nwill lead probably to better integration\nbetween us and integration is a physical\nkind of a process and there are a large\nnumber of you know the domains in which\nwe are thinking that we will be able to\nintegrate ourselves starting from\noperations operational logistic\nintelligence training H legal a number\nof such issues and they are part of a\nphysical process they have to be made\nenduring it's not specific to particular\ntenure of Chiefs and cdss so we're\ntrying to put those things in place and\njointness probably would create a\nBedrock or the foundation for\nintegration and that would uh create a\nfoundation for for further set of\nreforms which we are attempting where we\nwill be able to function in a kind of a\njoint and integrated kind of\nenvironment as you try to achieve this\nuh task um there was there was some if I\nmay use that word Bad Blood uh between\nthe Army and the Air Force as some had\nargued when the Air Force was seen as a\nsupport arm where do you stand on this\nis the the Indian Air Force a support\narm I think that's a tricky one G uh but\nI think when armed forces officers use\nof words actually there's a meaning\nbehind it and some sometimes we actually\njust catch on to a particular word\nprobably and so probably what general\nraat when he said that he meant that air\nforce is the only service which can\nsupport the operations of other two\nservices and the reverse is not true\nthat means Air Force can support the\nland operations they can support\noperations in the maritime domain but\nthe reverse is not to no none of these\ntwo Services can actually support air\noperations which are independent in\ntheir own nature field so that places\nAir Force or their operations in a very\nunique position and it is so unique that\nthe leor of Air Force actually has\nprompted other two Services also to\nacquire Air Force of their own and today\nif you have an Air Force with the Navy\nthey are part of the executive branch\nand uh in case of the Army in case this\nApachi is coming then probably they'll\nalso be part of a fighting arm so\nthere's no question of someone being a\nsupporting arm I think we read too much\ninto this particular word actually what\nhe meant was that's a service which can\nsupport the operations of other two\nservice I think that should put the\nwhole thing to rest now and the all the\nthree services are on the same page\nyou're moving forward with the pace at\nwhich you want to you have a road map uh\nto to achieve the goals that you've set\nout to achieve sir uh yeah uh we did\nthat right at the beginning uh when we\nset out actually talking to each other\nuh me there were the haters after\nGeneral raat passed away for about 9\nmonths unfortunately we lost that amount\nof time so uh and uh during the first\ncdss time probably there was Co and he\ndidn't get time because of that\nphysically meetings could not take place\nand then there was this uh problem on\nthe Northern bard this fortunately for\nme nothing like this happened I had all\nthe time and I had all the support of\nthe three Chiefs with me in fact uh\nduring a first meeting we organized it\nat the National Defense Academy we\ndidn't do it in Delhi we went back to\nNDA we went to the Hut of remembrance\nand then came back for the meeting and\nthereafter it's been I would say not so\nsmooth right if they were so simple\nactually to iron out the differences\nmeans I wasn't required then so it's\ntaken some amount of convincing each\nissue has been debated uh we would have\nmet in this past year and 5 months or 4\nmonths I have stayed at CDs more than 13\non 14 occasions where the chief of staff\ncommittee has met and they have come to\ncertain conclusions which we have\ndocumented they will form part of a\nrecommendation when the government seeks\nit from us sir is the work\nhampered by the absence of a national\nsecurity\nstrategy so many years 7 decades plus\nafter\nIndependence do we have a national\nsecurity strategy do we have stated\ngoals or are the Armed Forces working in\nsilos unable to fine-tune their\ndoctrines and the strategies because we\nour national security strategies still\nwork in\nprogress uh let me say like this you\nknow\nG uh when you look at National Security\nstrategy so there's a WR document which\nyou can say is a policy a policy exists\nand then there's a written document then\nthere are processes and there are\nstructures there're three uh all three\nor four have to be in place actually to\nit to succeed so\nuh we have the structures and processes\nwith us correctly had we not had that\nprobably we wouldn't have been able to\nreact to a CO situation in a very\ncalibrated kind of manner or what you\nmentioned that Bala strikes or even when\nwe abated article 370 people thought\nthat is going to lead to Bloodshed no so\nwe were able to do that thing quite\nsmoothly so the processes and structures\nare very strong over here now let me\ngive you two examples you know probably\nthe most threatened Nation threatened\nNation on this Earth would be Planet\nwould be I think\nIsrael and they don't have a n written\nNational Security strategy the last one\nwhich they wrote was in 1956 Ben goran's\ntime so they have survived without that\nand our immediate neighbor they came out\nwith a national security policy which is\nlike a strategy in 20 uh 22 actually and\nimmediately after that they went into a\nwhole lot of political crisis economic\ncrisis that start putting that strategy\nor the document in place didn't help\nthem true so this later part is\nimportant you know uh your policies\nthere without policy how do you function\nonly the written document is not there\nwe are clear as to what our structures\nare how do we take DEC strateg decs this\nis all well laid out we meet regularly\nthe number of structures which we have\ncreated so that helps us uh and of\ncourse whenever there's some work on on\nthat written part also they'll do it so\nthat should not hamper us actually\nbecause you have a you know the nation\ntalks about a stated goal uh by 2047 we\nwant to be viasit bhat a developed\ncountry by 2047 by 2027 28 you want to\nbe the third largest economy that's a\nated goal as far as our armed forces are\nconcerned do the Armed Forces also have\nMilestones on what we want to achieve\nand by when as we move forward to being\nperhaps you know one of the strongest\narmed forces in the world yeah you're\nright so uh recently there were the talk\nabout you know the national Vision uh\nthat is 2047 that we want to be a strong\nIndia shash bat uh a developed country\nactually Sam bat and uh for this one of\nthe legs of this would be a military\nthis thing you have to be a strong\nmilitary also so shash bhat should be a\npart of that suit the bat or a developed\nNation so as far as the armed forces are\nconcerned from this National Vision we\ntrying to draw out a vision for\nourselves which should be applicable to\n2047 uh we have trying to divide it into\nthree timelines one would be of\nimmediate I say 2027 or so in which we\nhave\ngreat amount of clarity as to what we\nwant to do which I just mentioned about\njointness integration and Joint\nstructures for conducting operations\nwhat kind of capability which we have\nwhich we desire and we will get and uh\nthe second of course would be a time\nframe of 27 to about 37 in which there\nis also fair amount of clarity now as I\nsaid you know from 37 to 47 for the\nArmed Forces is difficult to predict\nbecause any development Armed Forces\ndoes not follow a kind of a linear\nprogression so there could be something\nwhich is very disruptive which comes in\nlike in this particular War suddenly the\ndrones have come up or hypersonics have\ncome up in a big way so really can't\npredict very very accurately for the\nthird phase but yes we have some trend\nlines and we have something in mind what\nwe should be in 2047 we also will try\nand articulate vision for ourselves uh\nmaybe uh give us some time and it'll be\nstand of\nformulation sir I was hearing one of\nyour um closed door interviews in which\nyou also said you know your interaction\nwith with with the forge where you said\nyou cannot be a strong Nation on\nborrowed weapons um and you cannot win\nWars with borrowed weapons what's your\nthinking on atbar bhat but first\nelaborate on on this sir and then on\natbar bhat should also be there but\noperational efficiency of the Armed\nForces should not be adversely impacted\nwhere do you stand on that how do we\nachieve that\ngoal okay I'll take it in a reverse\nmanner I'll speak about ATA\nfirst uh you know sometimes we are\nlooking at\nATA from a narrow prism of Defense\nmanufacturing only I think ATA is\nslightly more than that uh self reliance\nand atbara both these words actually\nstart with\nself looking at\nyourself uh and that will lead to\nself-realization and\nself-actualization and that\nself-confidence which you'll get after\nthat so it has a broader kind of an\nAmbit defense manufacturing is a smaller\npart of it so as I said what you quoted\nactually that we can't actually V future\nWars on uh borrowed technology and\nborrowed weapon\nsystems uh what actually I meant was we\nare trying to chase Technologies and\nweapon system which already\nexist I'm saying again we are trying to\ndevelop a system or uh maybe a\nHypersonic missile or a particular ship\nor a missile which we want which already\nexists people have developed and then\nthe Dru Etc trying to chase it then we\nwill induct it into the Armed Forces or\nchange a tactics adopt a tactics to\nincorporate that system and thereafter\nwe'll change an organization if we\ncontinue this process we'll always be\nbehind that curve we'll never reach\nahead so what uh I have been trying to\npropagate for some time now is\nthat uh a tactics Le kind of a thought\nprocess of development in which uh we\ndecide as to how we forward to fight The\nFuture war and uh that is absolutely\nunique to our circumstances our methods\nof fighting a war which is based on our\nkind of a Terrain our realities our\nadversaries and once we decide that then\nwe look at supporting technology and\nweapon systems which will fructify that\nparticular tactics and we when we do\nthat then beat that curve which has said\nyou and come up ahead along with the\ndeveloped Nations so we'll have to for\ndoing all this actually there'll be a\nlot of mindset change which we will\nrequire that's the focus and emphasis\nwould be and when we talk of future Wars\nwe're looking at what's happening around\nus in the world a Russia Ukraine war\nwhich was seen as a short sharp Special\nOperation has been on for 2 years is is\nthat a you know our lessons learned from\nthere and or the Israel Hamas kind of a\nsituation where hundreds of terrorists\nenter a country and carry out the kind\nof miim that the Hamas did in\nIsrael what is the you know lessons\nlearned from there and the threat that\nwe face in our in in our\nneighborhood uh every war will produce\nits own\nlessons and uh we can't extrapolate or\nassume that these kind of Wars will be\nfought in our\ncontext I think uh each War the way it\nwill be fought is first uh defined by\nthe political military objectives which\nhas been set for that particular\nWar uh that is one and of course\ntechnology uh would be the second thing\nuh geography would be another Factor\nwhere this war is being fought the\nclimate geography Etc all this will\nDefine the uniqueness of\nthat particular war or kind of in\nConflict so like uh in the Ukraine war\nif geopolitical objective or political\nmilitary objective was to retain amount\nof territory the lesson is that you know\nif you retain territory there's going to\nbe a very prolonged War so that's a big\nlesson actually for us uh and no and\nHightech uh uh you know surveillance\nsystems Etc are not a solution for\nactually being keeping boots on ground\nas far as surveillance of your borders\nof governance of your borders are\nconcerned I think these are two big\nlessons for us but as I said our\nscenarios our Wars which we think would\nbe based on our geography our threats\nand our adversaries and will be entirely\ndifferent from what the wars which you\njust mentioned sir uh since you\nmentioned boots on ground uh that that\nwould mean uh we would need soldiers uh\nto protect our Borders or achieve our\naims off flate there has been tremendous\ncriticism general of the AG uh you know\nwhere where some people argue some have\nargued that they are not as capable or\nwill not be as capable as long-term\nsoldiers um and by the time they're\ntrained Vis deployment at the Lac\nthey'll be you know perhaps they'll not\nas good as the Chinese soldiers that is\nbeing argued where do you stand because\nyou train soldiers you guide soldiers\nyou use soldiers in combat where do you\nstand on\nagns uh again I think\nuh me that's a view which I have also\nread you know against agiv who is going\nto use these\nagiv it's a commanding\nofficer people who are on field actually\nis there any uh you know dissonance\namong them no see these guys are quite\nhappy because ultimately a commanding\nofficer who is at The Cutting Edge of\ncombat he gets to choose what kind of\npeople he wants actually in his unit\nwhat could be better than that so people\nwho are going to use this the AGS have\nno problem the people who are going to\nuse or work with these AGS who will be\npart of the team to fight a war or a\ncombat situation or operationally get\ndeployed they have no issues the larger\nissues are from outside actually some of\nthem are from our own veterans actually\nso I won't talk about others veterans\nbecause you know times have changed but\nyou know some times you get stagnated\nand you think about a particular thing\nso I think you have to have a fresh kind\nof a look this is a very transformative\nkind of in scheme and uh this is not\nonly for the Armed Forces but it's going\nto strengthen the nation actually I\npresume and times to come and that's the\nway I look at it and uh it's working out\nwell we've had no issues till now to two\nbatches are already there on training uh\nthe first batch uh means uh in 27\nactually probably would come out and\nthere's lot of time for us to know look\nat if there are any shortcomings in this\nscheme uh but as of now I think uh\npeople who are using this have mean\ntaken a feedback from the soldiers who\nwere there as agns we've taken up a\nfeedback from the commanding officers\nwho find them absolutely fine so I don't\nthink there's a problem on those two\naccounts uh it also has a major\nadvantage if I look at it\nstrategically you know just mentioned\nabout long duration war or Ukraine kind\nof an War we earlier had the system of\nreservist liability with this scheme\nthere's not going to be a reservist\nliability people you earlier people if\nhe retired say soldier after 17 years\nhe's a two 3 years of Reserve liability\nhe had that system didn't work out well\nactually we not been able to use it or\ntest it actually after\n71 in this uh by a simple notification\nand can increase the terms of Engagement\nto 5 years I have 50,000 soldiers extra\nfor that particular year what better\nthis thing in times of National\nEmergency otherwise we continue like\nthis I think it's a very good scheme you\nthink agir is a good scheme it's working\nuh and it gives you reservists overall\nwhen you look at the National Security\nscenario uh you know it's often said\nthat armies are used only when diplomacy\nfails otherwise armies only in sure that\nthere is no transgression or your border\nis not um uh\nvulnerable are our borders vulnerable U\neither the northern Borders or the\nWestern borders is the threat from a\nfinancially weaker Pakistan diminished\nor remains as big as it\nwas uh let me again take the later part\nfirst you know uh Pakistan may be in\neconomic kind of in turmoil and uh maybe\npolitically also slightly unstable now\nof course they have a proper\ngarment but uh militarily there's no\nbeen denting in his capabilities\nactually and we should never consider an\nadversary uh mean we should get full\nmarks to that adversary that's a better\nway of looking at things that's how I\nlook at things so uh they retain their\ncapability and they have that capability\nso Pakistan remains a threat so you\ncan't say that Pakistan Armed Forces\nwill not remain a threat yes there may\nbe a challenge for them to fight a long\nWar because of the current economic\nproblem which they have but they remain\na threat for us as for the borders is\nconcerned I think uh they're reasonably\nwell secure uh I just told you know\nprobably today Himalayas were very very\nsecure for a very very long time for us\nthat was but today we as I said you know\nthis impediments of geography can be\novercome uh today the technology affords\nyou actually to alter geography\ngeography for centuries and generations\nand millenniums has been the same it\ncouldn't have been altered and this is\nbut today technology affords you it can\ngive you Mobility uh today that's what\nhas happened actually across Himalayas\nso you're connecting passes so a new set\nof challenges come up which you didn't\nanticipate but then I think we have\ntoday resources uh to take care of our\nborders especially the disputed borders\nuh in the north very well and the bigger\nrole do you see a bigger role for us in\nthe Indian Ocean region and especially\nthe indopacific how does that hold out\nfor India in the long run uh does that\nalso ensure if we are stronger there\nthan Vis Pakistan we much uh in a in a\nbetter position and vis a uh you know\nthe northern adversary China that also\nputs us on a stronger Wicket does it\nyeah so\nuh mean I've said that you know our\nfuture or Destiny or opportunities would\nlie in the Indian Ocean region uh and\nthat's a fact of geography which\nactually I told you uh if you look at\nour major adversary the Chinese and look\nat their geography I'll just bring out\nsome facts of\ngeography uh so to be a superar if which\nthey aspire to be they'll have to\ncontrol at least two oceans\nBritish actually control the Atlantic\nand the Indian Ocean region Indian Ocean\nthey control because of aen and\nSingapore actually and India similarly\nthe Americans they control two\noceans as far as Chinese are concerned\nactually they have a trouble so\ngeographically they are ringed by a\nnumber of islands actually so but anyway\nto P super power they'll have to look at\nPacific and Indian Ocean region if they\nhave to choose between the two I think\nIndian Ocean region would be a ocean of\nchoice first why because because it sits\nastray you know Europe Middle East and\nuh the Southeast Asian countries so\nbetween two economic hubs and energy\nhubs consumers and users it strides\nthere so Indian Ocean will remain\nimportant for the Chinese unfortunately\nfor them access to this ocean is also\ndenied because you know there are only\nfour choke points so that's again a\ngeographical disadvantage for them so uh\nfor us uh we presume that once the plan\nis you know today there are 350 ship\nNavy tomorrow there may be in 20 47 or\n500 ship Navy when that happens\nobviously this area will become\ncontested but then of course we also\nwould be stronger by then we also will\nbe stronger by then\n[Music]\nor which is where we are moving forward\nmore assertive in in this uncertain\nWorld General Chan for joining me here\non this India Today special as always\nmany thanks sir thank you\nthank you very much General Chan

but\nit's also among the most Progressive it\nis the first country to introduce the\nconcept of gross national happiness\nrather than GDP as a measure of economic\ngrowth the second is uh that the aidite\nMr topgay is a truly impressive\npolitician with innov ative ideas a\ncommitted\nenvironmentalist uh a cultural Advocate\nand a yoga Enthusiast inspired I'm told\nhe tells me that by Mrs to

designing\ncities from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia to\nEgypt they're building cities\nIraq to\nHonduras and even California are\nimagining cities now close your eyes\nagain if you had the power what type of\nCity would you build what type of City\ncan you\nimagine what if you had a canvas to\nbuild a city and what if that canvas was\n2,000 square kilometers\n2,000 square kilm is 30% larger than the\nunion territory of Delhi it is 50 times\nbigger than New\nDelhi three times bigger than Mumbai\nthree times bigger than Singapore what\nif you had 2,000 square kilometers as\nyour canvas and what if that canvas now\nclose your eyes what if that canvas was\nnot desert was not flat was not\nfeatureless but what if in that canvas\nyou had\na river Meandering down one\nborder the river called Manana steaming\nwith Fish And among them the endangered\ngolden Masia and on the other side of\nthe canvas you have the sunos\nriver\ncapable ready to generate more than\n4,000 megawatt of clean energy and what\nif near these Rivers two Mighty rivers\nare two old\nancient protected\nareas biodiversity hotspots teeming with\nwildlife and birds and fungi and\nflaws and what if these two protected\nareas are connected by a biological\nCorridor so\nthat\nelephants and tigers and\ndeer\nleopard bird\ncan roam freely what\nif in the center between the two\nnational parks the protected areas are\nundulating land with water features and\nPatty Fields small hamlets what if to\nthe north are the foothills of the\nmighty Himalayas and to the South the\ngenerous\nopen Plains of Great\nIndia how would you imagine a city there\nhow would you bring in\nthe ideals and principles of gross\nnational happiness and how would you\nbuild a city a city that is built on\ngross national happiness for the 21st\ncentury g&h\n2.0\nvisualize visualize\nhard would your city being driven would\nyour city be taken over and be driven by\nmarket\nforces or would you design a city aimed\nat enhancing the well-being and\nhappiness of its\nresidents would your\ncity has\nskyscrapers like any other city or would\nit be low Rises would it be\nbuilt on Stone on Timber on\nmud would it be built\nsustainably would it integrate gradually\ninto our\nforest would would your roads and\ntransport be\nsustainable would you continue to take\ncare of the\nbiodiversity hotspots the two national\nparks not just take care but would you\nguarantee it for the next Generation\nwould your entire city not just be\ncarbon negative not just be sustainable\nbut be carbon neutral and in fact be\ncarbon negative being the first carbon\nnegative city in the\nworld\nthis\ncity envisioned imagined by his majesty\nthe king is called the gfu mindfulness\ncity a\ncity that will enable people to

a\ndevoted following across India and\nindeed around the world you're just an\namazing person great talking to you uh\ntoday I look forward to our next time\nI've been following him for a while he\nwrote a wonderful book called inner\nengineering my\nI came across this man teachers online\non YouTube and he blew me away I really\nreally enjoyed this he gave me a lot to\nthink about I am so honored and so\nappreciative to have sad Guru here just\nlearned a lot from this fine gentleman i\nl i l I'm so happy to be here with sad\nGuru I'm honored to have you here\ntoday\nbut I really love this man because he's\na motorcycle driver he's in the world\nand yet here's this massive\nGuru what do we need to do to kind of\nreset ourselves well it's in\nengineering we needed a kickstar mind\nblowing we have engineered the outside\nWorld in so many ways but we have done\nnothing about this one if you want to\nknow\nwell-being in is the only way\nout for the very first time in the\nhistory of humanity we have the\nnecessary resources capabilities and\nTechnologies to address every issue on\nthe\nplanet I said what will I do with\nbillion dollars my interest is 7 billion\npeople all of us come from the same soil\nall of us eat of the same soil all of us\ndie and go back to the same soil so soil\nis a unifying\nforce soil is not our property it's a\nlegacy that's come to us from previous\ngenerations and we must pass it on as\nliving soil for future\nGenerations welcome to mahashivaratri\nin this 20 and odd\nyears Mah ratri has become a massive\nFestival the only one of its kind in the\nworld right\nnow it is only by turning inward that we\ncan create a world full of love life and\nlove\nlet's make it\nhappen can I now invite on stage shivar\nsenior executive editor India Today\ntelevision to take the session forward\nwith\n[Applause]\nsguru\nsit down\nplease one\n[Music]\nminute\nmil\nmun\nsh\nNamar namk\nyou ladies and gentlemen the word kug\nlike our guest today needs no\nintroduction uh we use the word uh\nkalyug almost as a throwaway term in\ncommon language every single day if we\nsee something surprising or unusual or\nabsurd we use the\nword it's a word that describes the\nfourth age of the Hindu World Cycle uh\nmarked by decadence and depravity and\ndarkness a word that is less popular but\nhas seen a Resurgence recently thanks in\nno small part to the\ncertain Mand that has come up in aodha\nis the word Ram Raja which is defined as\nan age of fulfillment and peace and all\nthose other lovely things the opposite\nreally of kaluk so the question is can\nthere be a ram Raja a word we're hearing\nso often now with\nkaluk there's frankly no better person\nto answer that question than our guest\ntoday sadguru jagi vasudev seen as a a\nyogi a Mystic a Visionary someone uh who\nhas broken the internet several times\nbefore 4 and A2 billion views on YouTube\nin 2023 alone which is an incredible\nfeat uh he is\nsomeone who is seen by his millions and\nmillions of followers a growing number\nuh as a kind of nucleus of inner\nfulfillment which is a commodity as you\nall know uh which is uh extremely rare\nin the K I'm going to explore that as\nlong as you see it as commodity you\nshall not have it so amidst this\nmerciless churn that we're all a part of\nnow we're about to dive\ninto Enlightenment that doesn't take\nitself too seriously and in my view that\nperhaps is really the key so I'm going\nto start by first welcoming sadguru\nthank you sir for your time and for\nbeing here at the India Today conclave\nalways a pleasure to host you ram\nRaja in kaluk over to you namaskar to\nall of\nyou well first of all we are not in kug\nlet's understand\nthat this whole kug thing is being\nrepeated because at the end of\nkurukshetra\nWar Krishna talked about\nkaluk but according to the Precision of\nthe\nplanet that every 72 years Planet covers\none degree of the zodiac if you go by\nthat it's a cycle of\n25,920\nyears and it is eight parts of time that\nis two satyug to tra through two dwapara\nand two kugs and kalyug comes together\nso together it is\n25,900 uh plus years which is already\nover long time ago by\n2083 you will complete daper yug and\nyou're moving into tra yug so very\nappropriate to talk about Ram Raj\nbecause he's from that\ntime so this kalog business is like you\nread an old newspaper and you keep\ntalking about the same thing forever\nthat was\nspoken in\n3,140 BCE that is when the kurukshetra\nended so kug is long time over ramaj is\na choice metaphorically it means a\nstriving a striving for a just\nrule I'm insisting on this it's a\nstriving it doesn't mean everything was\njust during Rama's time everything was\nnot just there's a whole lot of problems\nout there but there was a striving who\ncan strive for such a thing it's very\nsignificant that\nwe don't refer to him I know of course\nsome people out of their love for him\ncall him Lord but generally he is\nreferred to as\nPur Pur means a UT among the\npuras a human being who has risen a man\nwho is\nrisen he has risen to a certain height\nwithin himself because this is\nessentially a\ncivilization where we are not waiting\nfor some Gods to to descend from\nsomewhere we are always seeing how to\ndevise ways where a human being can rise\nto his ultimate possibility or the\nhighest possible place that he or she\ncan be in so in that context we are\nreferring to\nRama because I'm South Indian I call him\nRama all right we got this issues I'll\nbe coming to South we will come uh so we\ncall him marada Ram because he has\nrisen in some way this has always been\nthe way of this civilization never\nbefore we have talked about people\ncoming down from heaven we are always\ntalking about individual human beings\nrising to their fullest possibility so\nin that context ramaraja means striving\nfor a perfect Nation or a just nation\nwhich was striving right through his\nlife\ndid he achieve it or not is not the\npoint the point is somebody is striving\nbecause human life is made like this\nonly a dead person will have a perfect\nlife living people can only strive if\nthe striving stops that's a dead life so\nwe are talking about striving for a just\nSociety not a perfectly just Society\nsuch a thing never\nhappens sguru the Prime Minister talk\nabout ramaj you were at the pran\npratista of the Mand in aodha as well\nyou you've spoken about it uh my\nquestion to you\nis are we moving towards Ram Raja is the\nprime minister moving India towards a\nram Raja see if you are looking at Ram\nRaja this is exactly what I said just\nnow if you're thinking of a perfect\nState no but are we striving yes we are\nstriving like like never before\ndefinitely I believe prime minister has\nthe intention to strive to create that\nnation that all of us want will it\nhappen tomorrow morning that's a joke if\nyou think\nso it never happens like that it's a\nstriving if all of us are striving in\nthat striving our lives are beautiful\nnot because we got there it's beautiful\nlife is beautiful because we are\nstriving for something that we hold as\nvery\nhigh what in our country right right now\nuh you know by the government by the\nprime minister or the things you see\naround you sguru are indicators to you\nthat this striving towards Ram Raja is\nsomething that is happening the reason I\nasked this question is because we uh\nlive in a\nconstantly churning viated atmosphere\nwhere there are polarized opinions as\nfar as that is only in the new it's not\nso in the country only in the newsrooms\nit's\nviated uh if you live in the country in\nthe rest of the country apart from Delhi\neverywhere everything is\nfine so don't believe that I mean you\nare supposed to make us believe that you\nshould not believe that\nso so the thing is viated viated where\nis it\nviated see one uh one lose can shout\nsomething well it's repeated 125 times\nin a day on the news channel none of us\nheard that\nnonsense that whatever some mad nonsense\nrepeated over and over again on the news\nchannel is not heard by anybody else in\nthe country and nobody else is saying\nsuch things so country is not viated\nit's a very wrong notion please walk\naround the Villages of this nation which\nis where we live and we work there is no\nany kind of viated Divisions in the\ncountry I I was talking about I was\ntalking about the political sphere I\ntake your point about the media but I\nwas talking about no I'm not trying to\nblame the media it's media's business to\nhighlight that I'm not saying you\nshouldn't be doing it I'm just saying\ndon't believe it because you are taking\nout certain things which make news and\nthat is not the nature of the nation so\nin the nation right now there is a huge\nstriving for economic well-being is\nthere a striving absolutely absolutely\neverywhere there's a New Hope in The\nVillages everybody is thinking they will\nlive better they're already living\nbetter you can say maybe not exactly but\nthere is a hope because they better\nconnected they're striving for more and\nI think a whole lot of people because we\nhave schools in rural areas we see\nchildren are eating better it's visible\nit's very visible whichever part of the\nworld I go the first thing I look at is\nthe rural children if you look at them\nyou know what is the condition of the\nsociety our children's condition has has\nbeen terrible in the last 50 years but\ntoday you will see in the last 3 to 4\nyears time young kids who come to school\nat 5 or 6 years of age they are little\nbetter\nfed uh which is an indicator which is\nclearly visible so are they striving yes\nthey are striving will we get there I\nthink we will unless we goof it up in\nsome big way the way the trajectory is I\nthink in the next 5 years there will be\nbe a significant change do you believe\nthat everything will be perfect no that\nwould be foolish to even think like that\nbut will people be living better\neconomically yes it is just that we have\nto manage the other aspects of Life\nequally well one important thing that's\na concern for me is right now on an\naverage the soil organic content this is\nsomething maybe a strange language for\nall of you because you live in Delhi\nbecause you don't use soil you all came\nfrom Mars Maybe I don't know I don't\nknow where you come from but the soil\norganic content in the nation on an\naverage is\n0.6% the minimum organic content that is\nnecessary to call Soil as soil is 3% but\nwe\n0.6% this is a disaster unfolding you\ncome from the south next time you fly\nfrom Delhi to Bangalore or somewhere\nevery 5 minutes just look out and see\nyou see a brown desert which you call as\nIndia this is dangerous this is very\ndangerous that anytime things can just\nfold upon us it doesn't matter how much\nindustry we do whatever other economic\nstuff we do if the soil collapses life\nwill collapse in a very bad way some of\nthe responsible scientists in the world\nare estimating between 2045 and 2055 20%\nof the world's population could commit\nsuicide mainly because of soil nutrient\ndeficiency these are responsible\nscientists these are not uh you know\nRabel\nrousers that that's you know your work\non soil conservation and save the soil\nuh is something that we've tracked very\nvery closely uh and uh uh it's one of\nthe things that made you a climate\nleader as well across the world we've\nseen your videos as well sadguru from\nfrom soil I want to sort of drag it back\nto a media issue since you've blamed the\nmedia for Med I I describ the media the\nmedia must take the media must take its\nshare of the blame there's no doubt\nabout that but uh you know being a\njournalist I must explore some themes\nthat are uh uh you know big headlines in\nthe media and things that you've spoken\nabout you know like I said uh sadguru's\nvideos have millions of views 4 and a\nhalf billion views in one year is\ncertainly no small feet and one of the\nvideos that uh you know has perhaps got\nsome of the maximum views since 201 19\nwas actually on the topic of CAA the\ncitizenship Amendment act uh which kind\nof went into the doldrums during the\npandemic sadguru it's back now with the\nrules being notified uh you were seen as\na proponent of them at a time when there\nwere large scale\nprotests 4 years later sadguru what do\nyou feel about it the government has\ndecided to notify the reason I ask is\nbecause it pertains to things like\nreligion Faith government what do you\nthink it doesn't pertain to any religion\nit is too little compassion coming too\nlate that's my description of\nCIA too little compassion coming too\nlate because when we left people on the\nother side of the Border post\npartition there was hope that they will\nbe well taken care of and there was also\npromise in the political space that if\nthere are problems will take you back\nbut over 75 years they have faced the\nworst of the worst and many of them are\nmoved here over 30 40 years ago and they\nstill refugees in this country are we\nnot ashamed are we not ashamed that\npeople are here and historical blunder\nwhere nations are divided and somebody\nfell on the wrong side of the line and\nthey tried to correct it and they came\nover 30 35 years ago and still they\ndon't have citizenship they don't have\nany rights in our country we should be\nashamed of this this is not a\ncontroversy this is a matter of\nShame there have been comments about it\nbeing\ndiscriminat certain politicians have you\nknow painted those who may come in in a\ncertain way those things are being said\nsir they're not being said by the media\nthey being said I know but I'm asking\nyou when there are countries which are\nTheocratic theocracy means by\nlaw discrimination all right in the\nsociety there is so much discrimination\nit is also there in our society we are\nnot some perfect Society we have\nthousand varieties of discrimination in\nour society but by law nobody is\ndiscriminated in this country but in the\nneighboring lands by law they\ndiscriminate there is blasphemy laws\nwhich if you just say a word you could\nbe hung for it when these things are\nthere if people are persecuted and they\nwant to come over and that to you put a\ncut off date I don't think there should\nbe a cut off date but you put a cut off\ndate for whatever reason that's fine as\nI said it's too little compassion coming\ntoo late after people have suffered for\ndecades in the in the kalyug that we\nlive in right now no we not in kalyug we\nin dwap yug okay you're saying it's not\na kug as a as a journalist I think there\nare many aspects of kug that we live\nthrough I I'll explain it to\nyou uh you know elections are a nuisance\nis something that sguru had said many\nyears ago no no I did not say elections\nare Nuance let let me let there must be\ntime for election and there must be time\nfor administration yeah if there is no\ntime for administration and only\nelection is going on and once again if I\nsay something don't think I'm blaming\nyou because of 24 s news channels if\nthere is a byelection in nagaland you\nmake me feel there is a national\nelection going\non all\nright that's because no election is\nsmall sir it is not small but you must\nunderstand whether it is somebody else\nor you or me suppose we were in election\nlet's say we were politicians standing\nfor election the nature of the election\nis such it's one on an emotional basis\nnot on the basis of sense and fact and\nfigures that's not how election is won\neverywhere in the world whether it's\nUnited States or UK or India elections\nare won on an emotional basis hello yeah\nyes so when that is a thing we tend to\nsay irresponsible things at the time of\nelection you must give us a margin\nbecause this is a democracy 3 months\nbefore the election we will say all\nkinds of things but if there are\nelections throughout the 5 years if you\ngo on saying this throughout the 5 years\nthat becomes The Narrative of the nation\nthat is a\nproblem most people may not know this\nand I want to just say that most people\nmay not know this that one nation one\npole is a is a is a thing on the table\nright now uh but it was actually sadguru\nWho had who was one of the earliest\npeople to talk about it he was the first\none of the few people uh I think back in\n2008 if I'm not misten when you he had\nsaid you know why this constant 24/7 365\nday a year proximity to the next\nelection every time an election gets\nover very close to the next election so\ndo you believe ramr will be one nation\none\npole I think one important step towards\nRam Raja is one nation one\npo\nbecause see right now the argument is oh\nbecause you are going to win this time\nyou're doing this because people are\nsaying that to BJP because it looks like\nthey are going to win but this is the\nimportant thing an election is never won\ntill it is won anybody who assumes that\nwill make a fool of themselves no\nelection or no war is ever won till it\nis won so why somebody is thinking\nyou're going to win and you will be at\nan advantage no the problem is this we\nhave built political parties who need\nemployment on a daily\nbasis this is not necessary in any\ndemocracy during the election political\nworkers and supporters come together and\ncampaign for election throughout the 5\nyears they campaign and they're asking\nfor renumeration for that this is not\nthe way to run a nation definitely once\nin 5 years is all we can afford if you\nask me till we get to 10 12 trillion\neconomy we should have election once in\n8 years I know people will want to kill\nme for this but we should have election\nonce in8 years till we get to at least\n12 trillion economy because you are\nenjoying the rubbish that you're talking\nyou must go down to the Villages and\nremote parts of the country and see\npeople are living like cattle till you\nchange that you have no business to be\ntalking about nuances of\ndemocracy so not 5 years 8 years no I'm\nthat won't happen I'm just saying you\nneed that much break to make significant\nprogress see if any policy is brought in\nany changes are made for it to go down\nto the last man in the rural space it\nwill take 6 to 8 years to get there if\nyou don't give it that much time before\nthat policy happens another election\nsome change will happen another person\nwill come and reverse the whole thing\nthis is not the way to run the nation if\nyou're interested in the people if\nyou're only interested in your politics\nthat's a different matter politics are\nfor people people are not Scapes go\nscapegoats for politics let's understand\nthis sguru there's a great deal of VIs\nible religiosity in politics uh and\napologies for dwelling on politics but I\nam a journalist so I just want to\nexplore some of those themes is there a\nlack of spirituality in politics as\nopposed\nto spectacle and visible religiosity and\nthis comes at a time when uh you know uh\nreligion and the state is a central\nissue of debate and discussion what\nwould you call a\nspectacle something that's visible\nsomething that catches your attention\nlike Ram\nTemple\nyes so you must understand this is the\nnature of the\ncivilization that every small thing\nevery aspect of our life we make it\ncelebratory this is the nature of the\ncivilization if you take that away we\nare not baras at all because in this\nlife if a child is born we will\ncelebrate we we poke their ear we\ncelebrate the child eats solid food we\ncelebrate child goes to school we\ncelebrate because this is the nature of\nour existence because without\ncelebration no matter what you have you\nwill become depressed over a period of\ntime celebration does not mean eating\nand drinking as people understand in\nDelhi celebration means Joy celebrations\nmeans exuberance of life so to bring\nthat exuberance of Life many things are\ndone so our temples have always been\ncelebration every day there is some kind\nof Celebration every day is a special\nday today is ekadashi tomorrow is\ndadashi next day is something every day\nis a reason to celebrate because we\nunderstand human Inner Space so well we\nknow if you are not in a mode of\nCelebration you will naturally move\ntowards depression the world is going\nthere watch my words the world is going\nthere s Guru uh you know you're always\nvery visible uh you're always in the\nnews I'm sorry and and\nuh uh you know the things you say almost\nalways go viral uh recently and for a uh\nfor a an especially a young generation\nyou were in the headlines when you uh\nattended the pre-wedding celebrations of\nanant Amani in Jam nagar many of those\nvideos have also gone viral I just\nwanted to show our view remind this\naudience about what they saw because\neveryone saw this on their phones can we\njust play that video very quickly\nthat so this was that video uh in Jam\nnagar that's Diljit dosan the famous\nsinger uh meeting very respectfully uh\nwith sguru so my question to you sir is\nuh stars and you know tycoons and all\nthose people over there uh and my my\nquestion is a very simple one do you\nfeel out of did you feel out of place or\ndo you feel out of place in places like\nthis I'm asking I'm asking not a loaded\nquestion I am in place anywhere on this\nplanet I don't know how I will be on the\nmoon but on this planet I'm always in\nplace the problem is\nthe cameras are on only when you are\namong certain people I teach in the\nprisons in many parts of the world you\ndon't bring the cameras we've seen those\nvideos we've seen those videos yes I\nwork with the tribals and in The\nVillages No cameras come there 70% of\nour work is in rural India cameras don't\nget on there only when you are in big\ncities and in events cameras are on\nPlenty of cameras so why would I be out\nof place in any way they're just human\nbeings beings for me there are no\ntycoons there are no criminals there are\nno tyrants for me there are human beings\nand every human being is has a space for\ntransformation a criminal can be\ntransformed a tirant can be transformed\na tycoon can be transformed so I am\nalways on it doesn't matter who he\nis so I I'd like to uh you know ask a a\npersonal question I actually want to end\nwith this question but since you've\ntalked about transformation I'd like to\nask you this question uh you probably\ncouldn't meet a more unspiritual person\nthan me I'm me you know I'm a\nnon-believer I'm not spiritual and we've\nactually had this conversation before\nbut uh uh you know in terms of feeling\nintensely of Faith No let me let me\nclear this what would you say to someone\nlike me sir since you're saying that\neverybody uh you know in that sphere see\neverybody wants to be the best I'm the\nmost unspiritual why are you the most\nunspiritual I'm here\nyeah because your idea of everybody\nsomebody says I'm the greatest devote\nsomebody says I'm the worst uh atheist\nit doesn't matter everywhere you want to\nbe number one don't be that you're\nnobody is number one all right it's a\ncyclical world we all come and go nobody\nwas born first are you Mr Adam you're\nnot right so nobody is number one about\nyour idea of being spiritual your idea\nof being spiritual is somebody who is\nlooking up and chanting a mantra or\nsitting in a temple or a church or a\nmosque no they are people who are\nlooking for some kind of solace in an\nestablished form but spirituality\nessentially means that you are a Seeker\nsee you must understand the fundamental\ndistinction when you say I'm religious\nyou refer to yourself as a believer that\nmeans you believe something\nwhen you say I'm spiritual you refer to\nyourself as a\nSeeker when does somebody become a\nSeeker you can become a genuine Seeker\nonly if you realize I do not\nknow if you see I do not know you don't\nhave to label yourself I'm a Seeker the\nnature of human intelligence is such if\nyou realize I do not know it starts\nlooking it starts seeking so seeking is\nnot a cocked version of life it is the\nnature if you don't mess with life if\nyou don't mess with your children they\nare all natural Seekers if you don't\ntell them stories for which you have no\nbasis they are all natural Seekers but\nwhy do you become a Believer you cannot\nhandle the uncertainty of seeking so you\nbecome a Believer what will you believe\nwhat somebody said someone means who\nsomebody that you hold as high or\nsomewhere it is written written in a\nbook which you hold as sacred so\nessentially you make an authority into\ntruth in your life it will give you\nSolace but it will not give you a\nsolution a Seeker means he's not looking\nfor Solace he's looking for solution\nwhere truth is the only authority\nauthority is not the truth so when you\nsay I'm the wor I'm the least spiritual\nperson no no if you have thousand\nquestions or a million questions that\nmeans you're a Seeker so spiritually\nspirituality means it's a seeking not a\nconclusion what would you say you know\nif someone came to you sadguru and said\nuh you know I'm skeptical of\nspiritualists and uh you know and and\nyogis and Mystics and things like that\nwhat would you say if if they were\nasking you to convince them to believe I\ntell them even I even I'm very skeptical\nof all of them including\nmyself so so you must understand there\nis a difference between doubt and\nsuspicion doubt is very\nhealthy you doubt because of that\nquestions\narise question cannot be\nwrong see questions cannot be wrong only\nthe answer can be wrong so you don't\nhave any problem that's all I'm saying\nas a journalist because you're always\nasking questions and questions cannot be\nwrong so if somebody thinks a question\nis wrong that's because they don't have\nan answer so the way we have handled\nquestions in this world till now is if\nsomebody asks a question and you don't\nknow the answer kill the questioner that\nis handled well handled in that\ngeneration nobody ever dares to ask that\nquestion once again you kill one man\nhere in this hall for asking a certain\nquestion you think anybody else will ask\nthat question again it's settled so\nwe've been dealing with things like this\nthat time is over this is the age of\nspiritual process because questions will\ncome everybody will ask questions you\ncannot stop them from asking questions\nat a time like this this civilization\nthat you call as bat becomes most\nsignificant in the world because this is\na place even when so-called Divine\nentities came we only ask them questions\nthey could not give us any Commandments\nsha came if you open his mouth his wife\nshe asks him a thousand questions she\nfreaks him with questions Arjuna Krishna\ntries to open his mouth after 36 years\nof Association to the person who is\nclose to him he tries to open his mouth\nthat that to in an extreme situation\nlike a battle that guy asked hundreds of\nquestions you know I was we were\ntrekking in Tibet and uh they were they\nwere nearly about 30 plus nationalities\nwith me and uh one Indian person from\nAmerica started asking a\nquestion Indians have 10,000 years of\nquestion asking\npractice so he's asking question inside\na question inside a question the\nquestion went on for about 8 minutes and\nall the other people their eyeballs were\nrolling because they're not able to\nfigure out what is the question then I\nsaid you stop it you know this an Indian\nquestion you guys won't understand this\nbecause Indians have been practicing\nasking questions like this endlessly you\ngo into any Indian scripture question\ninside a question trick questions and\ntrick questions then one Chinese lady\nraises her hand and says sadguru I\nworked in the United Nations for 27\nyears even there only Indians asked\nquestions this is a fact because this is\na culture where we encourage questioning\nbecause this is a land of seeking this\nis not a land of believing we don't have\nbelief system we seek MTI is the\ngoal no this is true Indians do last a\nlot of questions everywhere uh sguru\nsays since you do believe in very simple\nquestions uh you know if someone were to\nask you what should I do in my good\ntimes what should I do in my bad times\nwhat would you say to them if you think\nthere is a good time and a bad time you\ngot it all wrong you're alive it's a\ngood time when you're dead it's a bad\ntime for\nyou you're alive and you think it's a\nbad time you're missing the whole point\nbecause you must understand how old are\nyou sh can I ask yes I'm 43 43 44 years\nago where were you 45 years ago where\nwere you you did not exist yes terrible\ntime I'll I'll bless you with another\n110 years that means 60 years later you\nwill be again\nDead all\nright you didn't you won't exist Your\nExistence is just a brief time here in\nthis you're dividing what is good time\nand bad time all of us will be dead for\na very very long time and we are alive\nfor very brief time in this don't create\ngood time and bad\ntime living time is the best time no uh\nyou know a visual of sadguru comes to\nmind every time he talks about good\ntimes and I'm going to uh play that out\nonce again while I ask my next question\nuh these are you know very popular\nvideos of you come prepared no no no no\npreparation we are journalists sir we\ndon't\nprepare uh and so these are images of\nsadguru you know dancing you know and\nand the jumping during those\ncelebrations and people love this you\nknow this is there's a there's a there's\na lovely theme of abandon and just\nletting yourself go in these images so I\nwanted to ask you sadguru about feeling\nin intensely you know we live in a time\nwhen uh you know our emotions are\nconstantly under demand feel intensely\nthis way or the other way is that the\nway to live to feel intensely or or does\none need to embrace a more kind of\nmedium\npath so once again you must make up your\nmind you want to be alive or\ndead okay when have you have you been to\nany funeral yes not yours I'm saying\nsomebody else's you've been that man\nwill be in that perfect posture like\nthis he\nis till yesterday he was hopping around\nfor so many things you go and tell him\nyou won the\nelection he won't\nrespond he's not interested you tell him\nyou won a lottery 100 crores he won't\nrespond not interested you tell him\nwhatever he won't\nrespond what happened to him only thing\nthat he lost his life but suddenly he's\nnot interested\nanything you must understand that's the\nonly damn thing you have life everything\nelse is your imagination in your\nhead so good time bad time richness\nwealth money this that if I just take\nout your memory I don't have to steal\nyour account if I take out your memory\nyou lost all your money right hello I'm\nasking you I don't have to come and\nsteal your wealth if I just take out\nyour memory or wealth is gone your wife\nis gone your husband is gone your child\nis gone yes or no so the only thing you\ngenuinely have is life but that is one\nthing most people do not experience\nbecause their misunderstanding their\npsychological process as existential\nyour thought and emotion is a\npsychological drama that you are\ncreating and you believe it is true see\nit is like you build a castle in the air\nand after some time you start building\nleaving it's true then we say you're\nneurotic after some time you start\nliving in that castle then we say you\npsychotic then the third person comes\nand collects rent for that castle we\ncall him a\npsychiatrist amazing metaphor uh\nsguru picturing it in my mind right now\nuh you know in the so do not ever think\nyour psychological reality is reality\npsychological reality is made by you I'm\nasking all of you right now can you\nthink of a\ntiger hello like the Prime Minister was\nasking you to close your eyes I won't do\nthat but if you close your eyes can you\nthink of a Tiger Mountain ocean River\nflower so you can create any reality you\nwant in your mind but but now you gotten\ninto compulsive cycles that you think is\nreal no it's your drama if your drama is\nnot directed by you you are a disastrous\ndrama you speaking of drama sguru and\nthat that brings me to a question I\nwanted to ask as well which is that in\nthis age I I I know you insist that this\nis not kalyug but in this age when no\nthat is according to the cycle of Earth\nnot me okay uh uh what is kug and Tra Y\nis not a question of opinion okay okay\nit's a Time the search for meaning uh\nyou know has increased in a time of uh\nyou know post pandemic suffering people\nuh you know feeling lonely feelings of\nisolation Etc uh has led to a profusion\nin some ways of uh you know of quacks\nonline people who distribute kind of Pop\nspirituality in this age and you are so\npopular and people follow your words so\nclosely how do how do people\ndifferentiate\nfrom you know a real spiritualist\nperhaps for want of a better phrase and\nsomeone who's fake you know we see\npeople getting exposed all the time Jay\nshetti who is you know globally uh uh\nyou know praised Etc he's been uh you\nknow written about recently as having\nfaked his past Etc how do people\ndifferentiate sir see uh you don't\nbother whether somebody is real or fake\nif it works for you just do it if it\ndoesn't work work for you just ditch it\nwhy are you wasting your life trying to\nmake a judgment whether somebody is real\nor fake that's not your business your\nbusiness is whether it works for you or\nnot your following speaks for itself so\nthere's no question about that but uh uh\nyou know you've been criticized in the\npast I'm sure there are people pursuing\nall the time nobody has criticized me\nendless abuse abuse so I want I want no\nno that is one thing that's uh yeah that\nI want to talk about how\nhow do you handle the abuse because I\nimagine because the abuse is in their\nhead why should I handle it I don't\nhandle the abuse see they're they're\nconstantly writing fiction about me I\nlive it to them if they're enjoying it\nwell if it impedes my work then I deal\nwith it otherwise whatever anybody is\nsaying I don't respond to it because\nit's in their head what can I do see\nright now for example I'm sure this is\nall over so I will say\nthis we are about 130 km away from a\nelephant\nCorridor but there is a whole bunch of\npeople who keep on saying we are on the\nelephant cor 130 km as per all records\ngovernment of India government of Tamil\nNadu the World Wildlife Fund everything\nsays this but some people will keep on\nsaying because on the social media there\nis no pry law if you tell a lie you\ndon't go to prison in this country\ncountry by telling a lie you can win an\nelection you can become a chief minister\nor some other minister by telling lies\nso there is no pry there is if you get\ninto any defamation laws it is you who\nsuffers not them because you get trapped\nin the court and its Pro processes\nunless it is done like that that you\nknow if somebody publicly tells a lie\nquickly it can be proved if it is proved\na lie they must they must pay for it\nthere is no such law it's very difficult\nto do it because when half a billion\npeople lie how do you create prisons for\nthem there's no possibility so it's all\nright after some time people learn to\nfilter what is a lie what is the truth\npeople understand 5 10% of the people\nwill believe the nonsense you it's okay\nwhat to do do do you do you uh separate\nsguru the abuse from criticism there is\nnever been any seriously there's never\nany criticism only abuse because I'll\ntell you you know apart from save the\ncriticism means you must take something\nthat I have done and you must point out\nwhat is the wrong thing I did there if\nyou simply SPO Venom that's abuse there\nare there are many amazing things that\nuh sadguru and the and his foundation\nare doing uh I I heard from your team\nthat there's a uh Miracle of mind uh\nprogram that's going to be rolling out\nlater this year that is to do with\nmental health the reason I wanted to\nexplore the theme of abuse is you know\nif someone came and said something\nconstructive to you sadguru they said\nyou know who is sadguru jagi vasudev to\ntalk about Ram Raja how would you how\nwould you engage with\nthat see I'm made like\nthis I listen not only to people of\nposition anybody a man woman\nchild a dog donkey tree I'm always\nlistening\nI am who I am not because of anything\nbecause I listen I listen not just to\nthe words I listen to all the things\nthat are not spoken that's why I am who\nI am I'm not spending my time reading\nI'm not spending my time getting PhD\nsomewhere I'm just listening to\neverything to every life it's because of\nthat I am who I am so criticism I don't\nsee any issue with that I don't see\nwords as criticism somebody is pointing\nout a certain\nfact if it needs to be corrected it's\ncorrected without even thought about it\nI don't even see it as a criticism first\nof all I don't see what is praise what\nis criticism I just listen to where\nthey're coming from and that's about it\nfor me because my life is not enhanced\nbecause somebody Praises me my life\ndoesn't diminish because somebody abuses\nme I'm not made like that if I close CL\nmy eyes my life is\ndone well we've certainly listened to\nevery word you've said today sadguru uh\nand you've given us a great deal to\nthink about so thank you very much\nladies and gentlemen sguru\njagas thank you very much sadguru for\njoining us here at the India today\nconclave can I request Dr P Shamar Raju\nChancellor of Reva University to please\ncome up here on stage and hand over a\ntoken of appreciation to sadguru please\nhi a you becoming a\nstar she's a South Indian girl\nyeah\nnamaskar a big round of applause please\nfor S Unity\nbangal his cousin oh really\n[Music]\nfamily\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nthan\ncan I request members of the audience to\nplease be seated so we can kick off our\nnext session\n[Music]\n[Music]\nplease\nall right ladies and gentlemen our next\nsession is conscious urbanism designing\na mindful City and it's our honor and\nprivilege to be joined here at the India\nToday conclave by BRK Engles can I\nrequest you to please come upon stage\nfounder and creative partner of the bark\nEngles group and our session moderator\nRaj Chapa group editorial director\npublishing India Today group please put\nyour hands together I request everyone\nto please be seated for for our next\nsession\nplease just a minute yeah let everybody\nleave\nyeah good morning uh everyone please do\nsettle\ndown okay I think we'll\nbegin uh my job of introducing bra uh\ninels has already been done so\nbrilliantly uh by the bhutanese Prime\nMinister Top gay in his address early\nthis morning and uh which actually makes\nmy task much much easier in fact uh I\nwas uh I need to say that uh you're one\nof the greatest architects of of the\nmodern era I was also going to say uh\njust in in a general way that\narchitecture reflects uh the grand\ntapestry of human\ncivilization the footprints of human\nprogress if you could call it from the\nages uh from the Great Pyramids of Giza\nuh to the Magnificent temples and\nmonuments we have in India I don't know\nif you've seen any of them but you\nhaven't I would advise that you do uh\nand and that even today architecture\ncontinues to have the power to shape the\nworld around us that it repes represents\nin many ways uh how we see ourselves as\nwell as how we see the world and that\nbyak Engles represents the epitomy of\nall that uh he that he founded the Bak\nEngles group in 2005 with the acronym\nbig and he does think big really really\nbig um and uh I was also going to say\nand I you know saw experts describe him\nas the best representative of the new\ngeneration of Architects who combined\nshrewd analysis playful experimentation\nsocial responsibility and\nsurprisingly very good humor and lots of\nfun but I'm not going to see all this\ninstead all I'm going to say is that Bak\nAng Gill's work speaks for itself and so\nI'm now going to invite Bak Engles to do\nso ladies and gentlemen Bak\nEngles\nthank you thank you um I I I would like\nto take you on a on a little journey uh\nof um of let's say my architectural\nJourney that has now uh given us the\nopportunity to uh to imagine with the\nwith the king of Bhutan the the the the\nfuture city in uh on on the border of\nIndia um but maybe starting with this\nphoto this is uh a photo of all of the\nrichest people in Denmark and me um it's\nit's essentially the family that makes\nLego um Lego is a is a company that has\nmade everybody believe that Lego is from\ntheir home country uh but it is from uh\nfrom my home country and um we we were\nasked to design the the the home of the\nLego brick uh and we tried to imagine an\narchitecture that would be as inviting\nand engaging and inclusive as Lego is\nitself\nso the roofscape is a series of\ninterconnected playgrounds where you are\ninvited to play uh on top of the\nbuilding the building is open in in all\nfour corners so you can roam a Public\nSquare where light passes between the\ngalleries above you can roam around\nwithout a ticket and and then it may be\none of the only museums in the world\nwhere you are actually invited to touch\nall the\nartifacts and I think that's the point\nuh I want to make about Lego is that\nLego is not a toy it's a tool a tool\nthat empowers the child to create his or\nher own world and then to inhabit that\nworld through play and to invite her\nfriends in joining her in co-habiting\nand co-creating that world and that is\nessentially what architecture is uh the\nDanish word for design is form ging\nwhich literally means form giving\nbecause when you're designing something\nyou're giving form to that which has not\nyet been given form in other words\nyou're giving form to the Future because\nwhen you're designing a space or\nbuilding you're giving form to the world\nor at least a part of the world that you\nwould like to find yourself living in in\nthe\nfuture and and this can be very literal\nlike we're working with NASA on a\nproject Olympus where we are imagining\nuh the first permanent human settlement\non the moon uh it will be made by using\nsolar powered lasers to melt Moon dust\ninto uh uh this kind of obsidian U so\nessentially the first architectural\ntectonic of what will be the the first\npermanent human presence on another\nworld than uh than Earth um but there\nare also much more uh terrestrial ways\nof of Imagining the future uh two\ndecades ago we designed the Copenhagen\nHarbor bath that essentially extends the\nlife of the city into the water around\nit uh we also designed the harbor bats\nin in Aus and um on on the opening day\nwhen we suddenly saw the copenhageners\njumping into the into the water we\nrealized that this might be a bigger\nidea that uh that you know a clean Port\nis not only nice for the fish it's also\namazing for the citizens that suddenly\nthe copenhageners didn't have to drive\nfor hours to get to the beaches they can\nliterally jump in the port in the middle\nof downtown Copenhagen and we thought\nmaybe this is really a new idea and and\nwe called it hedonistic\nsustainability the idea that the\nsustainable City or building not only is\nbetter for the environment it's also\nmuch more enjoyable for the people that\nlive in\nit and and we've been pursuing this\npromise of hedonistic sustainability uh\never since uh this is copen Hill uh it's\na waste to energy power plant in\nCopenhagen uh it's so clean that the\nsteam coming out of the chimney is\ncleaner than the air of Copenhagen uh so\nwe've been able to turn\nthe we we've been able to turn the\nfacade into the tallest man-made\nclimbing wall uh in the world uh if if\nyou're too afraid to climb the facade\nyou can ride an elevator inside you can\nadmire all the technology that scrubs\nthe CO2 and filters particles from the\nair and you can reach the roof that\nwe've turned into a man-made uh Mountain\nuh Denmark is a country entirely without\nmountains uh so uh this is actually the\nthe place where you can Alpine Ski in\nthe middle of the city so it in a way\nit's it's it's turning this kind of\nMarvel of modern engineering into\nsomething blatantly uh clear that almost\nlike one of the main landmarks of of\nCopenhagen is uh a building that turns\nthe waste of the city into District\nHeating and\nelectricity um maybe a few sort of other\nexamples uh you don't have to build like\nan entire power plant or a city to make\na statement uh this is a one room hotel\nwe built on the Arctic Circle in the\nNorth of Sweden um it's essentially you\nyou living inside a swarm of\n350 uh bird houses so you wake up in in\nthe morning with a bird tweets uh you\nshower together with a squirrel uh and\nand you're literally surrounded by by\nlife uh uh\n360° beneath you uh and above you so um\nso almost like a complete Devotion to\nimmersion into into\nnature um another example we designed a\nmuseum in uh in Norway in a Sculpture\nPark and and we designed the museum like\na bridge that's expands uh across the\nriver uh two galleries uh resting over\nthe uh the\nriver uh and and essentially it's made\nout of standardized extruded uh aluminum\nuh elements all of them identical uh on\nthe inside it's made out of normal uh\nTimber painted white but by gently\nadjusting the position of each uh member\nwe create this kind of sculptural form\nso you can say it's creating out of a\nlot of ordinary elements something\nextraordinary and you can say the museum\nis is not only a museum it's also a\nbridge and and also a sculpture in in\nits own\n[Applause]\nright in uh in balaba in Prague we're\ndesigning the national philarmonic of\nPrague which is essentially connecting\nall the way from the from the river to\nthe roof uh sometimes philonic concert\nHalls can be very elitist institutions\nthis one is made as inviting as possible\nso even if you have no interest in\nsymphonic music you are actually invited\nto uh to to walk on the roofs and you\nmight suddenly uh like wonder what's\ngoing on inside and and you might\nsuddenly buy a ticket to a concert even\nif if you had no intention so\nessentially again to try to make the\nkind of elitist cultural institution as\naccessible uh and enjoyable as uh as\npossible and and and May sort of lastly\nas an example uh our our own\nheadquarters is located in the in the\nindustrial Port of Copenhagen uh and we\ntry to sort of design it uh so that it's\na seven-story building but no matter\nwhat floor you're working on you are\nvisually and physically connected to the\nto the floor above and the floor below\nso essentially uh all people are working\nas one team uh in one space even though\nit is a a seven-story building so trying\nto break down the vertical segregation\nation that that happens in a in a\nphysical space so so this is what our\nworkspace used to look like but then of\ncourse in in 2020 suddenly we had to go\nentirely remote because of the lockdown\nuh except um except our model Workshop\nuh we found out that the materials and\nthe 3D printers we use to make\narchitectural models could actually be\nused to making emergency\nmedical like B Shields and ventilator\ntubes so in the first 6 weeks of the\nlockdown we managed to manufacture\n25,000 of these\nartifacts them to the local Healthcare\nProviders and um and it gave us this\nidea it felt like almost by accident we\norganization the skills and and the\ntools to address what was one of the\nmost urgent uh uh um needs in the world\nat the time access to emergency medical\nequipment so we thought is there another\nbig problem that we we can address with\nour method and uh and and sort of um\nproficiency as as Architects and and\nplanners um and we thought why don't we\nlook at at the other range of the scale\nwhat if we actually make a sort of an\narchitectural Urban plan for the planet\num so um we started with a with a\nnumber 173,000 terawatt hours per year\nthat's the total energy consumption of\nall of humanity in one year and uh if\nyou look back 200 years we've always\nbeen burning wood uh to heat our homes\nuh but then we discover coal oil and gas\nand it becomes this incredible access to\nenergy even today Renewables is a very\nsmall part at the top and and this\nincredible increase in energy also led\nto an incredible increase in quality of\nlife if you measure it like life\nexpectancy on every continent you can\nsee the more energy we get the better we\nlive but of course it also has a\nnegative side effect every year we emit\n50 billion tons of CO2 uh and and\nanother one and another one every year\nand it it creates this layer in the\nouter atmosphere that traps heat and and\nis cooking our planet you know the story\nso the green gases come from Mostly four\ndifferent gases CO2 methane Nitros oxide\nand F gases and they come from a range\nof human activities and so to create a\nsimple um framework for the plan for the\nplanet we divided the problem into five\nvertical Transportation energy industry\nfood and waste these are the sources of\ngreenhouse gases and and climate change\nuh but there's another five verticals\nthat are unrelated to climate change but\nthat are essential to address if you\nwant to have a sustainable human\npresence on Earth so that's biodiversity\nHealth pollution habitation and and\naccess to to\nwater so because this is a a short\nlittle uh overview I'm only going to\ntalk about uh climate change also when\nwe started the the idea we were 7.7\nbillion we're 8 billion today uh we will\nbe 10 by 2050 so it's a slightly bigger\nproblem to solve for and we should all\nhave access to the same quality of life\nas say Denmark so it's actually double\ndouble the challenge if you like so um\nto make it tangible we boiled the\nproblem down to one Earthling so if\nwe're 10 billion Earthling like this is\nthis is a 100 earthlings uh you know if\na million earthlings would gather they\ncould stand on one square kilometer and\nand if all of Earth would go to a giant\nWoodstock concert uh they could fit uh\non 100 by 100 kilometers um but since\nwe're talking about Earth being able to\nsustain us uh what if we actually divide\nall of Earth into 10 billion equally\nsized plots of land um each of us will\nhave\n225 by 225 M to sustain us uh 2/3 is\nwater a tenth is uninhabitable and\nroughly one hectare is habitable half of\nit is nature and the other half is\npretty much agriculture with a little\nbit of\ncity and this is where all the problems\ncome from so if we start by looking at\nenergy energy is two3 of the emissions\nuh we use energy to power uh our\nbuildings our transportation and and our\nindustry all of these industries can be\npowered with uh a um\nelectricity uh uh with with current\nTechnologies so and if they become\nelectric we can power them instead of\nusing uh oil coal and gas you can say\ntoday each of us spent this much oil\nthis much coal and this much gas to\nsustain us in one year it's our equal\nshare of the energy consumption you can\nactually deliver the same amount of\nenergy with this much wind and this much\nsun and if we have the same energy\nconsumption as Denmark we need need a\nlittle bit more uh and we need to store\nthat energy with with batteries and\nhydrogen uh hydrogen can essentially be\nused for like a whole range of uh of\nactivities uh you know electricity but\nalso feriz Plastics uh green methane um\nwe already started converting our Fleet\nwe have 1 billion vehicles on Earth and\nwe're already making them uh battery\npowered but if you would try to uh Power\na Boeing 747 with batteries the battery\npack would weigh 15,000 tons making it\nvery difficult to fly uh so there's a\nwhole range of industries that require\nhydrogen as a as as a fuel\nsource then if you look at industry some\nof the emissions from industry come from\npower but some of them come from the\nchemical processes for instance um when\nyou\num uh when you burn time to create\ncement you emit CO2 into the atmosphere\nso if we replace materials like for\ninstance every time you replace one ton\nof steel or one ton of cement with one\nton of wood you lower the carbon\nfootprint of the building with 2.2\ntons there's everything we throw out of\ncourse we can recycle all the materials\nuh but all of the organic waste we can\nactually turn it into biomethane which\nis essentially the same as natural gas\nbut it turns our waste into a renewable\nresource similar to the waste to power\nplant we we designed in in\nCopenhagen and then there's the\nagriculture the biggest footprint uh the\nburps from cows and the rice fields emit\nmethane into the air uh when we burn\ncrop residue we emit CO2 uh uh into the\nair when we fertilize we emit nitrous\noxide uh and finally every year we\nexpand our Agri culture roughly one\nsquare meter per person which emits CO2\nfrom deforestation and and and\nRoots so just looking at at at some of\nthe things this is actually energy crops\nso these are crops we grow only to burn\nso we can actually produce the same\namount of energy with photovoltaics um\nmuch cleaner and and much more compact\nuh instead of burning crop residue we\ncan turn it into biomethane turning it\ninto a circular resource um instead of\nleaving the the land fellow we can Grace\nit with cattle uh and that basically\nleads us to the the elephant in the room\nor the cow uh a cow and a calf emits 100\nkilos of methane per year they need two\nhectares of of grassland um and 100\nkilos of methane per year is the same as\n108 tons of CO2 when it comes to to\nglobal warming\nto sequester that much CO2 you need one\ngrown tree per ton per year it just so\nhappens that 108 trees fit perfectly on\ntwo hectares of grassland and the\nnatural habitat for large herbivores is\nsilvero pasture the combination of of uh\nof forest and uh and grassland so if we\nconvert to Silver pasture we get happier\nand more productive cows we increase\nbiodiversity we increase yields and the\ntrees will sequester the CO2 that is\ncoming from the from the burps of the\ncows so for instance if you look at the\nlast 50 years um the land we've been\nusing to grow cereals has remained the\nsame but we've more than doubled the\noutput so simply by converting to\nalready existing proven methods uh like\nsilver pasture and and ply culture on\nexisting Technologies of best practice\nwe can actually take the necessary area\nneeded to sustain an Earthling\nsustainably from this uh to\nthis and if you add the necessary area\nfor windmills and and sun and we can\neven combine agricultural area and and\nuh and renewable energy production so\nyou can see the the the footprint\nnecessary to sustain Humanity can\nactually fit comfortably within the area\nthat is already available uh to us so so\nsuddenly it shows and and you know this\nis this is for one person uh this would\nbe to sustain all of the Dan and this is\nDenmark this is to uh Power and and feed\nall of the Americans and this is America\nso and and of course this is this is\nEarth so so what we're basically\nlearning as is that very often I've\nheard that if we all had the same\nquality of life as the west or let's say\nDenmark we we would need like eight\nEarths to sustain us and and it's\nactually not true and also I often hear\nthat we have to invent new technologies\nthat don't exist otherwise it won't be\nsolvable and that is also not true I\nmean of course the more energy efficient\nwe are and the better Technologies we\nhave the better but we actually have\navailable all the tools we need we just\nneed to put them into practice and we\nneed a plan for that and and of\ncourse such a plan has to happen at all\nscales we need to uh Electrify our homes\nso we can power them with with renewable\nenergy uh we need to sort of up upgrade\nthe building envelopes so we don't lose\nheat or or or cold we need to build with\nsustainable materials we need to harvest\nthe renewable energy that is that is\navailable we need to move between our\nbuildings with uh sustainable forms of\ntransportation and it's actually very\neasy to make our cities more walkable\nand bikable by making them\nGreener uh we need to convert to uh best\npractice we need to harvest renewable\nenergy we need to convert uh our waste\ninto a resource to power our industry\nand our transportation we need to\nconvert to best practice agriculture to\nfree up Green Space so we increase\nbiodiversity and the trees from the\nforest still sequester the CO2 we we\nstill emit so essentially at every scale\nwe need to have plans for implementing\nthis like very simple and and readily\navailable uh uh\nsolution so you can ask like what what\nsense does it make because obviously we\nwe're not commissioned by by Earth to\nmake a plan for Earth but um but I can\nalready see by having made the plan for\nthe planet it has given us and our\nclients and collaborators an overview\nand a Clarity we didn't have before and\nwe've started aligning all the projects\nwe do with the principles of the plan\nfor the planet this is a factory uh we\nbuilt in in Norway it's the most\nenvironmentally friendly Factory in the\nworld it's built from locally sourced uh\nTimber it's powered by local hydro\nelectricity uh we negotiated with the\nfire department that we only had to cut\ndown 5 MERS of forest so the evergreen\ntrees actually shade uh the the the\nglass so you're working you you're\nbuilding Furniture inside a forest um\nthe the timber Factory lowers the carbon\nfootprint but also makes a a beautiful\nwork environment for the for the factory\nworkers it's it's powered by photo\nvoltaics and the roof is covered in\nhabitat uh for for the local\nspecies um we're building the new\nairport in Zurich it's going to be the\nlargest Timber building on earth locally\nsourced uh Swiss Timber so again\nsignificantly reducing the the carbon\nfootprint uh of the building and also\nwhen you land in Switzerland you can\nalmost smell that you've arrived in uh\nin in the Swiss Alps um The Roof is\ncovered in photo voltages powering 2/3\nof the of the airport in Singapore we\ncreated uh capita spring uh a place for\nfor people to to live and work we\nconverted one of the streets into a park\nuh the ground floor of the building is\nopen as a as a public space and and\ninside you have a vertical Park that\nconnects the residences below with the\nwith the offices above all the way to\nthe roof where we have an urban farm\nwhere they grow all the produce for the\nfor the\nrestaurants\num in uh for the European commission uh\nwe are designing the uh The Joint\nResearch Center for sustainable\nConstruction in seia and it's the\nhottest city in Europe uh it's covered\nit's a public space and a and a a\ncommission building so by covering both\nthe building and the public space in\nphal tes we create a shaded public space\nuh naturally ventilated but by shading\nthe square we can actually leave the\nfacade of the commission transparent so\nthe the citizens of Europe can see what\nthe Commissioners are doing uh but at\nthe same time this canopy uh uh creates\na comfortable outdoor environment and it\nproduces twice as much power as the\nbuilding\nconsumes uh I I had the opportunity to\nspeak about this project in uh at the\nVatican and uh if you ever have to visit\nthe pope and you wonder what to give him\nusula felion already gave him a framed\nphoto of the of the joint Research\nCenter I'm I'm not a Catholic but if I\nwas I think this could be my ticket to u\nto go to heaven um and and maybe lastly\nfor for Google uh we designed their\nheadquarters in in Mountain View the\nlandscape you see around that beautiful\nparks are actually root Zone Gardens\nthat filter all the waste water so we\ncollect all the water from the roof and\nthen all the waste water is filtered\nthrough these beautiful root Zone\nGardens before it's l clean into the bay\nuh the the dragon scales of the roof is\nactually photovoltaic panels that\nconvert sunlight into into\npower so I think all of them are\nexamples of how our sustainable future\nnot only is better for the environment\nbut can also be more fun to work in and\nand More Beautiful to to to live in so\nso of course as an architect it's rare\nthat you get to apply all of these\nprinciples in in one go on on a on on a\ncity uh but that's exactly what happened\nwhen the the king of Bhutan uh reached\nout uh uh a year ago and invited us to\ncome to gfu in in the south of Bhutan On\nthe Border to to India uh and think with\nhim about making uh an entirely new\nadministrative Zone that could be\nattractive for the younger generations\nof the bhutanese and the Indians and the\nsurroundings to to to settle but based\non the principles of of\nBhutan Bhutan is an incredible country\nbecause nature is preserved 70% of\nBhutan is covered by Forest it\nsequesters twice as much carbon as as it\nemits it's defined by these river\nvalleys that run through the the\nHimalayas and you have Agriculture and\nand and living uh integrated it's it's\nalso a country where the history is\nstill very much alive the the kind of\nbeautiful dongs and the kind of arts and\ncraft is still being built today the way\nit was 400 years ago and that also means\nthat you have a a visual Urban\nenvironment where color and craft is\nomnipresent which makes it one of the\nmost beautiful places I've uh I've ever\nbeen um and it's it's also a place where\nspirituality is everywhere and and I I\nloved uh sat guru's definition of\nspirituality as seeking uh so\nessentially everywhere you go\nspirituality and and celebration and\nsharing of wisdom is part of part of the\npractice and and they've taken all of\nthe principles of vajana Buddhism and\nbaked it in to the nine parameters of\nthe gross national happiness index\nmeasuring their success as a nation by\nhappiness rather than economic output so\nwe thought for the mindfulness City we\nwould take the nine measures of national\nhappiness and use them to define the\nprograms of the city and also translate\nthem into design principles for for the\nsort of Urban Design of the of the\ncity so imagine the mindfulness City uh\nas as a place where nature is enhanced\nrather than displaced by the by the city\nwhere agriculture is integrated into the\nurban environment and where the\ntradition is still very much alive and\ncelebrated even in the Contemporary uh\narchitecture so the the place gilu will\nwill sit on is more than a th000 square\nkilometers uh it's two natural reserves\nbridged by an ecological Corridor where\ntigers can m\nin the highlands and where elephants\nmigrate from India to like from from the\nHimalayas to India uh so the rivers\nreally characterize the the the the\nlandscape and the scenery and you have\npeople living among the uh the rice\nfields so we developed a principle where\nthe city essentially sits between the\nhighlands and the border to India we\ncreate these ecological corridors that\nallow the elephants to migrate through\nthe city un un numbered connecting from\nthe Himalayas to to India uh we also\nhave a gravitational uh sort of R shed\nso that we get almost like these kind of\nmajor city parks and then like\nneighborhood parks along the smaller\nstreams uh and then the neighborhoods\nbecome almost like rice fields like\nlittle Terraces that Cascade down the\nthe Himalayan Hills and then the city\ngets denser and denser the closer you\nget to um to India then you have\nessentially a regional corridor that\nconnects to the the surrounding major\ncities and and India a kind of Lo local\nTransportation Hub for public\ntransportation and then a little like\nCommunity Street uh uh at the North uh\nand everywhere these Transportation\ncorridors cross the rivers a a bridge\nbecomes a major public building both uh\na connection and a destination so here\nyou see the airport itself is actually a\nBridge Crossing Three Rivers uh and when\nyou move closer\nyou can see like how how the city is\nreally defined by these linear parks\nthat uh that move through it uh also as\na principle you have six stories uh on\nthe lower levels uh and up until single\nstory in the highlands and that is\nessentially possible to buildt entirely\nwith mass Timber it's the greatest\nnatural resource of of Bhutan and and\nit's the most sustainable way to uh to\nbuild so we sort of sat down with with\nthe local Architects and developed a\nwhole family of building types where we\ncombine the available craft for like a\nsingle family a kind of\nmultigenerational family or even a kind\nof community um which means that when\nwhen you put these building types\ntogether you actually create this kind\nof perfect coexistence of of old and new\num the the local streets have permeable\nPavements so that water can penetrate\nthrough creating a resilient uh\nenvironment you have the waterfronts of\nthe rivers uh if you when you go oh high\nyou have people living between the the\nthe rice fields and and finally in the\nhighlands you have like very sort of\nreclusive and and sort of uh uh sort of\npossibilities for for extreme levels of\nof mindfulness and then for instance the\nthe airport also entirely made out of\nmass Timber and and and modular becomes\na kind of statement of of arriving to to\nthis to this new uh new place uh a\nvarana Buddhist center that is a bridge\nso when you cross from one neighborhood\nto the other you you see you know um\nspiritual leaders uh uh doing their\npractice as you pass through the uh the\nbridge uh um a healthc care bridge that\ncombines uh Western and and Eastern\nmedicine but also is a passage from one\npart of the city to another a university\nuh a young child going to school in the\nmorning can see what the the older\nstudents are doing and dream about uh\ntheir their future uh the market uh\nagain a destination on on top of the\nriver and a connection between between\ntwo neighborhoods and and maybe as the\nlast\nBridge the entire city will be powered\nby renewable energy so we're building a\na dam the river basically comes from the\nHimalayas and it continues into to India\nso we thought to uh design the the the\ndam as as as a temple Bridge as a as a\nbhane interpretation of the Indian step\nWells the entire facade is made\naccessible uh so you can actually walk\nin a thousand different pilgrimage\nroutes down the face of the dam to a\nkind of present\n[Applause]\nday a a present day equivalent of the\ntigers's nest uh so that um as as you as\nyou visit Bhutan and and this region uh\nit somehow consolidates all of the uh\nelements of the mindfulness City it's\ntaking a piece of infrastructure and\nturning it into uh uh uh spirituality\nit's taking a piece of engineering and\nturn it in into art so um so so maybe um\nwith with so and and and in some way I\ncould see that maybe the temple Dam\ncould be for the mindfulness City what\nwhat the ivel tower is to Paris or the\nor the Sydney Opera is to\nAustralia um so maybe just to end uh we\nwe presented uh the master plan together\nwith the King uh at the national day in\nuh uh in Bhutan in December and and\ncurrently uh accelerating the work on\nthe dam and uh and on the on the airport\nand and maybe just to end to give you a\na a glimpse of of the future of the\nmindfulness City we've created a little\nfilm that in in three minutes explains\nwhat what I did in in half an\nhour Bhutan is the vajana Buddhist\ncapital of the world a special place\nwhere wisdom and compassion have forced\na unique way of\nlife fiercely proud of their Traditions\nbhan have preserved their cultural\nvalues for centuries through a joint\neffort focused on sharing teaching and\ncaring their communities thrive on\nCollective well-being growing a society\nthat measures its Nation success are\nnine indicators of\nHappiness a land of mountains forests\nand rivers Bhutan is one of the world's\nlast remaining biodiversity hotspots and\nits first carbon negative country after\ncenturies of perfecting a life of\nharmony with others and nature hutan is\nnow ready to show the world how to\ncreate a sustainable human presence on\nEarth descending from the Himalayas to\nthe tropical Plains an uninterrupted\nflow of water plants and animals shape\nthe mindfulness City cascading Terrace\nFields become Lively neighborhoods\nnested along naturally connected\necologies inhabitable Bridges span\nacross biodiversity corridors connecting\ncommunities both physically and\nspiritually with centers for Innovation\neducation and\nRecreation the city may lead you on a\njourney of Discovery to connect with\nyour body mind and\nsoul a home for meditation and a place\nfor togetherness where knowledge can be\nshared taught and practiced with the\nworld's spiritual\nleaders the mindfulness City will join\ntraditional with new finding a balance\nthat is both respectful and creative a\nconstellation of public squares provide\ncenters for cultural Gatherings and\nfestivities while a network of social\ninfrastructure supports the community's\neveryday needs people of all ages\nabilities and backgrounds will share\nknowledge and ideas to grow future\nGenerations into the leaders of Tomorrow\nbhan Arts will be preserved and\ntraditional craft will expand through\nhandmade and advanced\ntechnology to build a city where\nengineering is Art and nature is power\nthe mindfulness City will become a\nGateway a bridge between local and\nGlobal past and future nature and\nHumanity it will be an invitation to the\nworld to participate in the bhutanese\nmindset to learn to teach and to share\nits values towards growing and more\nsustainable\nfuture a big round of applause please\nforkel thank you so much for joining us\nhere and teaching us how to div up and\nurbanize mindfully can I invite on stage\nlit Kumar Jan president thermal\nHindustan power to

y\n[Music]\ninkles\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nall right ladies and gentlemen the next\nsession is one You Don't Want to Miss\ntheori Mystique the rule book for\nbecoming viral influential and stylish\ncan I invite on stage our moderator\nsonel Vijay digital editor lifestyle\nEdition India Today group to introduce\nthe\nspeaker\nhello everybody if like us your\nInstagram algorithm is adamantly set on\nPaparazzi reels of Malaya M walking her\ndog in bandra and Sara Ali Khan going in\nand out of her gym chances are you have\nstumbled upon paparazzi's hooting the\nwords Ori Baba left and Ori Baba\nright AI has risen to fame more so in\nthe last few months with everything that\nis going on for him from a collaboration\nwith Netflix his Wild Card entry into\nthe big boss house and appearance on\ncoffee with Karan to being photographed\nwith ran at the recent Jam nagar wedding\nit's okay to say that this is A's world\nand we are just living in it I welcome\non stage Oran aat ranii who needs no\nintroduction because if we are being\nhonest we don't know what he\ndoes if I was you I'd want to be me too\ni'\ni' W to be me i' to be me i' to be me\nhello hi son thank you for being in\nDelhi thank you Delhi for having me okay\nI'm going to start my interview with the\nfirst question that pops up when I\nGoogle you Ori okay why is AI so famous\nnobody knows that and I'm going to add\nto it how did you get so famous so\nquickly okay sonal why am I famous now I\ncan lie to you and say I'm famous cuz I\nhave a pose I'm famous CU of the work I\ndo on myself but really I feel the\nreason that really brought me into the\nliel light is I am the famous and friend\nand there's no there are not many and\nfriends that are famous there's no John\nV kapor and friend and the and friend is\nfamous there's no Sahar Alik Khan and\nfriend this one and friend so I really\nthink being that and friend the tag that\nno one ever wanted is the tag I've\nreally built on proudly being the and\nfriend it's a full-time job so you're a\nprofessional friend is all what you are\nProf and friend professional and friend\nand friend it's not a friend it's an and\nfriend okay okay um you work in the news\nwhen you post a picture of someone and\nyou don't know who's in the background\nit's the and friend so I'm the recurring\nface in all the pictures so you agree\nthat a lot of your popularity is\ndependent on I can't deny that I'm not\nhere to deny what's obvious and not the\nmedia personalities who so in my first\ninterview with you I remember that you\nsaid I don't want to talk about any of\nthe celebrity names and now you've come\nsuch a long way I'm not talking about\nthem it's about me I'm the and friend\nthis this is the story and the journey\nof the and friend okay so this is A's\nworld and they all just living in it\nthere we go okay um they're the\nvariables the and friend stay oh that's\na smart one so this is how you got to\nbecoming famous so quickly one of the\nmajor reasons yes okay um okay so your\ncircle of friends is mainly celebrity\nchildren and now they have all become\ncelebrity this is and friend this is\nlike the poster for and friend there's\none recurring face in all the photos and\nthat's this one right here correct okay\num so a lot of them get trolled for\nbeing nepo babies right and you're\nyou're an outsider equally privileged um\nhow did you get around to becoming\nfriends with all these people and what\ndo you think about them constantly\ngetting into the whole bracket of being\nnepo babies nepo babies nepo babies how\ndid I become friends see each one has a\ndifferent story and we don't have the\ntime to say how I met this one or that\none and how we clicked but with the tag\nline of nepo babies I feel nepo baby\nnepotism has been given such a negative\nconnotation but if you apply to the\ncollege your parents went to and you get\npreference to go and you're called a\nlegacy child and it's treated so well in\nUniversity and so well in high school\nwhen you apply they are Legacy Kids\ndoors do open for them easily but that's\ncuz their parents have worked hard for\nthose doors to open I'm an outsider\ntechnically in this industry the doors\nthat open for me may not open for them\nand the ones that many open for them\nI've had to work very hard to have them\nopened for me but I would like the same\nopportunities for my kids when I have\nthem that the hard work that I've put in\nmy kids can inherit so you're not\ncompeting with the first generation kid\nyou're competing with the second\ngeneration kid right when you own a law\nfirm and your son easily gets into your\nfm it's the same privilege a nepo kid or\nlike I like to say a legacy kid gets in\nfilm like today if I'm friends with\ndirectors and producers and they ow me\nowe me favors I'm going to cash that\nfavor for my kid why would I not want\nthat privilege for my kid I have worked\nhard for it right today an outsider be\nit I'm not an actor but be a Kari and\nhis kids will be nepo kids should they\nnot benefit from the hard work that a\nKarthik Arian has done should shahak\nKhan's kids not benefit from the hard\nwork shahak Khan has put in right cuz\nnot you're not all someone is not born\nan Insider right you're not just born\nlike that your parent is and they worked\nfor it you know if I had if I had a\nrupee for every time you said hard work\nand working hard on myself I'd be very\nrich\nsorry work hard Ed me I was 74 kilos the\ntop comment was he keep saying I I work\non myself I go to the gym but he doesn't\nhave the body of someone who works on\nthemselves I'm 51 52 kilos today that\ncomment really stayed with me and I\nworked on myself I really did look at\nI'm not wearing a t-shirt or a shirt\ninside cuz the body can doesn't need it\nanymore I have to give that to you AI\nyou do work very hard on\nmyself yeah so I think I think your face\nphrase working hard on myself is is what\nKarina Kapoor did back then for that\ngeneration of jabby Med when when she\nsaid favorite who I think working hard\non myself became like the mantra for\njenz sonal you have one life live your\nbest life you're not working on yourself\nand you're not your own favorite person\nI cannot sit here in this suit with my\nories on it and you be my favorite\nperson or someone else be my favorite\nyou have to be the main character of\nyour own life and I think a lot of the\nyoung audience resonated with that\nbecause they've not been doing it maybe\nor maybe they've been doing it so much\nthey were proud that someone said it and\nthey can be like now I'm following that\nTrailblazer what do you feel about your\nprivilege do you carry it lightly or are\nyou very do you take it very seriously\nwhat privilege the fact that you come\nfrom a family uh that is a certain way\nthe fact that you you went to school\nwith a lot of celebrity kids who and and\nthat got you that access everyone has\ntheir own silver spoon and their own\nlimitations the Privileges that have\nbeen given and you've not and the\nlimitations that I have that you don't I\nwear them as like a bloody flag coming\nout of my shoulders like it's my cap I'm\nhere to flash all my privileges I don't\nneed to show you my limitations no one\nwants to show the sadder sides of life\nbut why would you not be an opportunist\nof the things you are born with why\nwould you not take full opportunity of\nthe things that are your Birthright why\nwould you not do that why would you not\nbe proud of that right so if I've been\nborn with something why would I not\nproud\nL have that and proudly take advantage\nof that be be greedy for your\nopportunities be greedy for your\nAmbitions you have one life be greedy\nfor whatever you want and don't let\nanyone tell you you can't and don't let\nsomeone who doesn't have what you have\ntell you oh you're privileged cool I'm\nprivileged let me live my life let's\nmove on right\nokay um okay so a big part of your\ninfluence is your party content I think\nuh I think as a media house sometimes I\nfeel like we struggle to get the party\ncontent quicker than you do because\nyou're so quick on your social media and\nI know you handle a lot of it yourself\nwhich not a lot of celebrities do um\nrecently you were at the biggest party\nin town in Jam nagar this is actually\none of our favorite videos uh of you\ndoing terrible\nGarba but you tried I tried I tried okay\nuh how was your experience of being in\nJam nagar um jam nagar and what's been\ncre there is really the most unreal\nplace in the world it's every part of it\nhas been so well thought of and well\nexecuted um the wedding was amazing\nvantara was beautiful and just\nabsolutely amazing and yes I like to be\nat every single party um when you talk\nabout privilege and this and that what\nother people say I don't want to be at a\npity party I just want to be I want to\nbe the life of the party I want to be at\nthe coolest party I just don't want to\nbe at the sad self moping parties and um\nthat being said my experience with I\nlove Rihanna for the longest time I\ndidn't know who she was and I read her\nInstagram name which is bad gyi but I\nread as balgir so I've been following\nbadal giri on Instagram and I loved her\nbadir as in sister of nilgiri\nbasically and um I'll tell you a little\nmarketing trick I have which maybe I\nshouldn't be releasing so early it's\ncalled o o o but you can also call it oo\nI objects of interest but objects of ay\nI'll make a little Museum one\nday in my outfit or my costume of the\nnight there'll always be a talking point\nso I knew Rihanna was coming and I've\nbeen on stage like what do you think of\nright now I'm speaking but if you're\nperforming what are you thinking of\nyou're looking at the audience I'm\nlooking at all you beautiful people I\nlove your hat I love your shoes I love\nyour scarf and your print so I knew\nRihanna would be looking and I had to\nhave a beautiful object of interest on\nmy head and I've worn these giant\ndandelion earrings knowing she'd see\nthem and rightfully she did and she\nstole them and she came and she said I\nwould like the earring please and I was\nlike well of course and I looked at my\nfriend take out your phone take out your\nphone this is the moment I I I like\nbrought these earrings for took out the\nphone took off the earring gave it to\nher 7 minutes later she's lost the\nearring and has come back for the other\none and so I like pinned it on her top\nso now we've got now you've got rihana\nof course you've got pictures with the\nwhole Amani family you've got deika\nranir pictures with\neverybody Pok who's on your radar now\nwhich celebrity would you like to get\nphotog with\nTaylor just say it the PM oh that me\njust you need to hang around here until\ntonight and that may just happen it may\njust happen yeah um okay um see the one\nreason I know you're never doing\nBollywood films is because you have\nterrible Hindi we can we can agree to\nthat right sure but it's script reading\nI can learn the the script okay I had to\nbut interestingly on world Hindi day the\nDelhi University students made a a real\non oriali Hindi so now you have\nsomething called the Ori speak okay is\nyour Hindi really this bad or do you do\nthis for virality so it is hilarious\nbecause I woke up to my Google Alerts\ngoing off saying Delhi University\ncelebrates National Hindi day with\noriali Hindi where all the students are\ncoming on stage and speaking AI versions\nof Hindi and I loved it and I myself\ncan't speak AI Hindi cuz I myself don't\nknow what I'm saying because\nunfortunately I can't think in Hindi so\nI'm thinking ofi I actually grew up in\nTamil Naru but um I'm thinking in\nEnglish and then there are a million\naies in my head scrambling to get the\nwords in Hindi like so I'm thinking hi\nmy name's orhan and all the aies in my\nhead are running what is my what his\nname what is\nOran translating it into Hindi and then\nprinting it into Hindi and it's coming\nout on my tongue in this jumbled paper\nmashe version of Hindi and it's I'm\nstruggling in my brain have you ever\nseen SpongeBob with there like a 100\nSpongeBobs in his head trying to make\nthings happen when I'm speaking Hindi\njust know that every gray cell is being\nsqueezed to its fullest so if you saw\nbig boss which is in real time live\nhindy and I'm giving it back to Salman\nKhan and I'm saying h under here and I\nthought I was

all right ladies and gentlemen we're\nall set for our next session India's\npath to a 10 trillion economy this\nsession is sponsored by mwani jera\n[Music]\nFoundation I'd like to invite on stage\nthe session moderator Rahul Cav news\ndirector TVN and managing editor special\nonline projects executive director of\nbusiness today to take this forward and\nintroduce the speaker to\n[Applause]\nyou\nover the past several hours we've been\ntalking about how Indians across the\nspectrum look at the India story whether\nthese are members of the government or\nmembers of the\nopposition looked at from the outside\nwhat does the rest of the world make of\nthe India story at this moment to talk\nabout this we're joined at the 21st\nEdition of the India Today conclave by a\nvery special guest all the way from\nSwitzerland the president of the world\neconomic Forum ladies and gentlemen can\nwe have a very warm Round of Applause\nfor bur BR please thank you very much\nfor coming down you were here just in\nMarch so to come back again so soon\nafter your last visit uh is very special\nand we deeply appreciate this so thank\nyou Mr Rand for joining us thank you\nit's it's great to be back where there\nis optimism oh fantastic uh because yes\nindeed India is one of the points in the\nworld where there is spark and optimism\ngiven some of the Gloom that we're\nseeing on a macro level given where\nIndia is at this moment how do you at\nthe world economic Forum see India's\nposition change on the global high\ntable so uh firstly congratulation on\nthe conclave uh great to be here um this\nis India centur uh India is the fastest\ngrowing of the large economy is uh in\nthe world remember when we met in Davos\nI said to some of your colleagues that\num we expected almost 8% economic growth\nin India at least at the last quarter\nlast year and they said that I was too\noptimistic we have no seen the numbers I\nwould say they were too pessimistic so\nuh on India uh we are very bullish and\nit's not only for this year or next year\nwe foresee\nthat India will be growing for the next\n25 years uh\nprovided of course that the reforms are\ncontinuing and it's not only that is\ngrowing but is also growing at the pace\nthat it's helping and supporting the\nrest of the world I think many would be\nsurprised if they learned that 15% of\nall Global growth last year came from\nIndia so one single country providing\n15% of the Global growth so it's of\ncourse then um creating jobs in India\nand opportunities but it's also a win-\nwin it's also with its demand creating\nopportunities for the rest of the world\nso we do expect that India will meet um\nthe 10 trillion US dollar economy uh in\nthe next decade we do predict that India\nvery soon will be the third Lar economy\nin the world and then I also launched an\ninterview with you um last year this\nnotion of\nG3 I think the G3 is no effect so let's\nspeak about that for a moment because as\nyou can see B is a very uh strong India\nBull and you coined this idea of G3\nwhich went viral in India and everybody\nhere loves you for that but\ninternationally there was a bit of a\npush back saying that you know you've\nleft out say Europe you're not really\nyou're overestimating the size of the\nIndia story\nand it's not as bullish and optimistic\nas you'd like to believe given that\nalmost a year has passed since do you\nthink we are closer to achieving the\nidea of a G3 or do you think we're\ndrifting further\naway I think it's there uh because you\nhave the US economy as the largest in\nthe world uh China uh number two and uh\nthere is just now a question of months\nbefore India will will take uh the role\nas the third largest economy in the\nworld of course you can have this notion\nof G3 that I coined of course you can\nalso say there is like a G4 or G5 or a\nG7 that we currently have but I'm I know\nthat um for India now it will continue\nuh if the reforms continue to be at the\nForefront of growth and very\ninterestingly we are now seeing that the\nemerging economies of the world where\nIndia is uh no among the real leaders\ntogether um with uh China is now 50% of\nall the global growth comes from the\nemerging economies and that will\ncontinue for the next decade um when it\ncomes to growth according to um the\neconomic uh statistics that we are uh\nlooking at and and from 2040 we are\nexpecting that the emerging economies\nwill be accounting for 60% of the\noverall Global growth so this is um like\na snowball and you know uh a snowball is\nsmall at the beginning but if it starts\nto roll it gets bigger and then it rolls\nfaster and that's India today wow you\nknow in case you didn't follow uh what\nBor said earlier he said that the coming\ndecade will be the decade of the G3\nthree which is uh the United States\nChina and India the difference that I'm\npicking up from what you said last time\nto now is that you're saying that the G3\nis already here so it's not a concept\nthat You' explained as being the reality\nof the future you're saying we're almost\nthere're already there that's that's the\ndifference now 10 years ago India was\nthe 10th largest economy in the\nworld today India is the fourth largest\neconomy in the world it's incredible and\nvery soon the third largest economy in\nthe world so I think uh the G3 coining I\nthink I'm um I'm I'm I'm very confident\nthat that will hold and it will even uh\nthen de develop further because the\ngrowth is faster now in India and of\ncourse there's a lot of things working\nin in India's favor the geopolitics is\nworking in India's favor because there\nis\nuh a change in the global value chain so\nyou do see a lot of companies then\nestablishing themselves and production\nand Manufacturing uh in India secondly\nyou have so much of uh a youth uh\nSurplus you you have one of the youngest\nuh populations in the world so 75% of\nyour population are in an age where they\ncan contribute to work and on top of\nthis you ALS also have fiscal\nPrudence it's maybe a bit boring but it\nis extremely important because you see a\nlot of indepted countries that are using\nmost of their money no one paying on\ntheir debt the interest India has been\nable to be fiscally prudent and there\nare reforms the reforms have to continue\nthough as so let's spend a moment on\nthat because you've you've spoken about\nwhat you think is going right give us\nyour sense of what more you wouldd like\nto see from India and from the next\nIndian government to be able to achieve\nuh the target of being A1 trillion\neconomy beyond the reforms that have\nbeen implemented this moment what are\nthe structural uh reforms that you'd\nlike the next government to push get red\nget rid of more red\ntape um more infrastructure Investments\nthat is already happening you know um it\nis real momentum there invest in even\nmore in education every child in India\nshould have access uh to good primary\nand secondary education and that's\nbuilding also of the strength of India\ntoday where India is very digitally\nliterate so taking into consideration is\n1.4 billion people and even a little bit\nmore than that um the digitally\nconnecting uh is at a very high level so\nno one has to capitalize on that I think\nalso to be a real hub for manufacturing\nwe see the second largest economy in the\nworld China is 30% of all Global\nmanufacturing is happening in China we\nare seeing more companies now\nestablishing themselves in India too but\nI think uh there you also have to look\nat the tariffs because today\nmanufacturing is getting input factors\nfrom different countries so you get part\nof it from Bangladesh you get something\nfrom Malaysia something from Vietnam but\nyou would like to put it all together in\nyour country and then you produce higher\nup in the value chain you got the profit\nyou can pay people better salaries and\nof course then you have to also look at\nthe tariffs on those products input P\ninput factors that you put into that um\nuh production and Manufacturing but all\nthis I think is gradually happening and\nthat's why you're seeing also the growth\nyou know as all of us know India is on\nthe cusp of the world's largest\nDemocratic exercise and one of the\nbiggest risks the world economic Forum\nflagged when you came up with your uh\ntop Global risks report was the Menace\nof artificial intelligence and deep\nfakes and the challenge this poses to\nelectoral democracy given that this year\nitself we've already had a few elections\nin countries like Indonesia and\ncountries like Argentina uh how much of\na threat do you think this is at this\nmoment given that in a few days from now\nour first phasee of polling will begin\nfor our loab elections one has to be\nvery Vigilant about it I I think uh we\ncan guarantee that the two of us are\nreal here um what you see is is is real\nbut we have no guarantee that uh this\ncan of course then be put into something\ndeep fake so I can be saying something\nelse and I literally has been saying if\npeople play with it and\nunfortunately there are a lot of people\nbelieving that everything they look at\nin social media is true so do people do\ncome up to me and say yeah but I I read\nthat on Facebook or read it on Twitter\nand said okay yes then it has to be\ntrue uh maybe but I think we need to\nlearn that things has to be taken with a\npinch of uh salt and that is not\nnecessarily uh the reality so we have to\nvaccinate also against that people\nbelieve everything that is in the social\nmedia you know when I grew up uh I read\nedited newspapers where there was an\neditor making sure that everything was\ncorrect in the paper and the Young\nGeneration now will need to maneuver in\na situation where of course they look at\nthe papers and they are still very good\nuh and also I know that India Today take\nbig uh pride in that but they also have\nto learn to take with with a big pinch\nof salt what we're seeing uh in social\nmedia but this is a reality this will\nnot change it will just accelerate and\nthe whole artificial intelligence uh the\nGen AI is a real game changer we think\nit's as\nimpactful as the internet maybe even as\nelectricity uh was so the world is\nchanging much faster but one has to make\nsure that you use the AI to the benefit\nof\nhumankind and I think there is huge\nproductivity gains that we can see in\nthe coming decade maybe even 30% and\nproductivity is really Prosperity if you\ncan produce the same with less resources\nyou can pay people better and you move\nup in the value chain so you have to\nembrace it of course we need traffic\nrules and I think India is also uniquely\nposition to gain from these new\ntechnologies because you have digitally\npeople you have hardworking people you\nalso have the key critical mass when it\ncomes to digital and digital services so\nbut it has of course then to go through\nunicorns and to then become the big\ncompanies of the future isn't that a\nvery elite way of looking at artificial\nintelligence because we also have a lot\nof people who don't have the skills and\ncould possibly be on the wrong side of\nthe artificial intelligence Genna\nRevolution where they left jobless\nunable to find and unable to come to\nterms with a changing World a lot of\nwork can now be done through\nautomation it is true that every\nchange represents both an opportunity\nand a challenge so we know that some\ncountries uh were the richest one after\nthe second world war and are no lower\nmiddle inome countries and some are the\nrichest countries uh in the world so if\nyou don't embrace the technology and use\nit uh\nproactively you can lose out in this\nGlobal uh\ncompetition and of course I'm worried\nthat some of the new technologies can\nlead to a Winner Takes it all because we\nseen that in the platform economy but at\nthe same time we also see that when you\nmove from the hardware phase of it to\nthe software phase of it there will be\nunique opportunities for a lot of\nsmaller and medium-sized companies and I\nthink the e ecosystem in India uh is of\nthat kind and and things do change like\nyou know in Switzerland where the world\neconomic for is based 100 years ago 95%\nof the population worked in the\nagriculture sector and it was not\nproducing enough food today 3% works in\nthe agriculture sector and they produce\ntoo much food and where did all those\npeople go of course they moved then to\nsectors that are producing higher OPP in\nthe value chain and that's why\nSwitzerland is one of the richest\ncountries in the world so you also have\nto use the enormous resources in that\nlabor to then uh produce more\neffectively and use that labor into\nother sectors it maybe sounds very\neconomically but you know it is really\nnot more advanced than Common Sense\nunfortunately common sense is not always\nthat common let's spend some time on the\ntwo big crisis that the world faces and\nI'll start with Russia Ukraine because\nuh for Europe in particular that's the\nnumber one challenge given the fact that\nPresident Putin is stronger than he has\nseemed in the last two years and that\nUkraine for various International\nreasons is not being able to push back\nin the way that the world would have\nwanted where do you uh see the Russia\nUkraine conflict go from where we at\nright\nnow so there were a couple of premises\nin your question that I would like to\ndwell on so President Putin uh wanted to\ntake Ukraine he thought he was going to\ntake Ukraine in a\nweek and he is one of the largest\nmilitary powers in the world wasn't able\nto so Ukraine pushed back and that was\nin a situation where they had no Western\nweapons they had all old Russian weapons\ntoday uh there is still an ongoing War\nuh there's only losers in this war of\ncourse in Europe we're much closer to\nthis conflict and you know also how\nparticular you about your borders and\nrightly so and Ukraine is also quite\nparticular about their borders it's not\nthat they borders were disputed they\nwere agreed in The Budapest memorandum\nuh the borders of Ukraine so uh this is\nan ongoing uh conflict when it comes to\nthe Russian economy the Russian economy\num is still growing but it's growing\nbecause it's no a war economy overall we\nseen three million people young people\nleft uh Russia these are young Math\nteachers scientists and Engineers we're\nalso very bearish on uh Russia's ability\nto diversify its economy in the years to\ncome so hopefully uh there will uh we\nwill find a solution uh to uh the war in\nUkraine based on international law I\nthink international law should always\nbeen uh be at the basis of these kind of\nnegotiations and when it comes to Israel\nPalestine uh given the fact that Israel\nhas been bombarding and attacking\ndifferent parts of Gaza but still hasn't\nbeen able to achieve its military\nobjectives which is to wipe out the\nHamas and given what we're seeing in the\nRed Sea with the attacks of the huis how\ndo you see that war progress what's your\nsense so uh I hope um for um a ceasefire\nI hope for humanarian assistance to the\npeople uh in Gaza I also hope for a\nsolution uh in the future where the\nIsraeli people and the Palestinian\npeople can live friendly uh next to each\nother also based on the two-state uh\nsolution uh it looks very complicated uh\ntoday but of course uh 7th of October\nwhen uh Israel was attacked by Hamas in\na terrible terror attack um has changed\nalso the way many Israelis look at this\nand I think uh also the way the world\nlook at at Hamas but still we should not\nforget that the aim in the future should\nbe that the Palestinian people and the\nIsraeli people can live uh peacefully\nnext to each other\nlastly let's spend a moment on the most\nunpredictable election of all this year\nuh the election in the United States uh\ngive every no not not the Indian one I\nguess huh are you confused about what\nmay happen no no I I I was uh that was a\nrhetoric question we we have to live up\nafter you know gone through Gaza and the\nUkraine I thought we had to get back to\na little bit more like bullish uh\natmosphere but you're sorry no no more\ncertainly uh given the fact that in the\nUnited States at this moment nobody can\nsay with any degree of certainty what\nmay happen in November what do you think\nis at stake for the rest of the world\ngiven that lot of polls suggest that\nDonald Trump has a very serious chance\nof being reelected as\npresident so let me um come to the\nessence of your question by just uh\nstating a couple of\nfacts at the\nbeginning India is the fastest growing\nof the large economies in the world\nfastest growing of the emerging\nEconomist but the US economy is doing\nalso really well so a year ago we're\ntalking about the recession in the US\nthen they said oh it will be a soft\nLanding there's no landing at all the US\neconomy is growing really strongly\nthere's a reindustrialization in the us\nwhere we see companies moving back to\nthe us we see an optimism uh in the US\nthat we haven't seen for decades and we\nare very bullish on the US economy\nmoving forward they have the critical\nmass they have the large companies\nheaded mostly by\nindian-americans uh it's also very uh\ninteresting so the US is in a good place\neconomically their political system is\nis not in the same uh good shape it's\nvery uh very\npolarized uh and that's going to\ncontinue uh until the elections but I\nthink the US can deal with this and we\nhave to deal uh also with um the outcome\nof uh the US uh elections no so I\nremember in January when we were at the\nworld economic forum and that was one of\nyour uh big themes of conversation in\nthe corridors and the sessions was\naround what happens if Donald Trump\ncomes to power how do you see the\nresponse to that question so what\nhappens if uh Donald Trump gets\nreelected so um we can listen to what\npolicies he wants to implement every day\nso we can make our own assessments of\nthat the world economic forum is a\nneutral uh impartial International\nOrganization we had Donald Trump twice\nin Davos we uh had had also President\nBiden uh when he was vice president uh\nin Davos so we will deal with uh the\nadministration that uh the US people uh\ndo elect of course some Nations\nespecially China is very worried because\nuh you heard Donald Trump has said that\nhe will put 60% tariff uh on on China\nhe's also said that he will put 10%\ntariff on\nuh other nations uh I think uh we will\nsee more and more clarity on the\npolicies uh moving forward but as I was\nsaying the US is now a fast growing\neconomy under Biden but the US economy\nwas not doing badly during Trump either\nuh especially before Co that was of\ncourse a GameChanger but the policies\nthat um secretary minuchin was\nresponsible for as a treasury trory was\nby many uh in the business sector uh in\nthe US uh seen uh as a very um sober uh\neconomic uh policy I I guess you wanted\nmore sun bites on this part you said\nyou're very very swis right very neutral\nnot wanting to lean in on either side\nand that's totally understandable B BR\nthank you very much for

zone\na stinging comic commentary I'd like to\ninvite the session moderator shivar\nsenior executive editor India Today\ntelevision on stage to introduce our\nvery special speaker\n[Music]\nso before shiv comes on let's just give\nyou a glimpse about our next guest and\nwhat makes the next session so\n[Music]\nspecial\napologies just give us a moment we're\ngoing to be playing that out for you in\njust a brief\nmoment joining me now to discuss the\nconflict in Israel and Gaza it's a TV\nhost in Satur is Bassam youf Bassam it's\ngreat to have you back on the program I\nwish it was under different\ncircumstances um first of all what is\nyour reaction to What happened on\nOctober the\n7th oh it was terrible of course I mean\nwe kind of get our news kind of also\nsecondhand because you know my my wife's\nfamily they live in Gaza they they have\nuh cousins and uncles there um and uh\ntheir house also was bombed we haven't\nbeen able to communicate with them for\nthe past 3 days communication are lost\nso we don't know actually what is the uh\nhow is like how are they're doing but\nyou know we're used to that I mean it's\nit's just like it's it's it's very\nrepetitive we used to that we used to\nthem being bombed every time and moving\nfrom one place to the other\nuh you know it's just like those\nPalestinians they're very dramatic ah\nIsrael killing us but they never die I\nmean they always come back you know they\nthey're very difficult to kill very\ndifficult people to kill I know because\nI'm married to one I tried many times\ncouldn't kill her I mean there's a dark\nhumor there and I understand why because\nno it's not dark humor I really I try to\nget to her every time but she uses our\nkids as human Shields I can never take\nher out I would say I really applaud\nIsrael for doing one thing that no\nmilitary\nforce in the word does because I heard I\nheard Ben Shapiro and I heard Rond\nsantis and they said they said Israel is\nthe only military force in the world\nthat warns civilians before bombing them\nI mean how cute that is so nice\nof them because with this logic if\nRussian troops started warning\nukrainians before bombing their houses\nwe're cool with Putin right I mean okay\nHabibi you have warned them go invade\nit's fine you have done your job\nall right ladies and gentlemen that sets\nthe stage for our next session viral\nfrom the Israel Gaza war zone a stinging\ncomic commentary shivar on stage to take\nthis\nforward uh I I really don't know how to\nintroduce our next guest after you've\nwatched that video uh fun fact I\nhappened to be in Israel when that video\nactually dropped so uh it was something\nthat absolutely exploded now Basim YF uh\nsomeone all of you have heard about uh\nthat video got 22 million views when it\nfirst came out and it spawned an\nentire uh ecosystem for want of a better\nword uh of knowledge and awareness about\nwhat was happening uh between Israel and\nGaza and Palestine uh this is a man uh\nladies and gentlemen who fled from Egypt\nin 2014 uh knowing full well perhaps\nthat the war for freedom of speech\nexpression satire commentary was going\nto make him someone who would spend\nperhaps the rest of his life on the run\nso we're very very lucky to have someone\nwho continues to spend his life\nprovoking commenting satirizing and\nmaking fun of the most serious things\nhappening in the most dangerous parts of\nthe world it is our deepest honor to\nwelcome basam\nYF\n[Music]\nthat's a very scary\nvisual hi everybody I am very pleased to\nbe here in India by the way this is my\nfirst time ever in India and this week\nyes this my first\ntime and and this week is very special\nfor me because in five days I'm going to\nturn 50 years old so the last thing I\nwould ever imagine that I would spend my\nbirthday in India and I have to tell you\nI've been here only for two days man New\nDelhi this is Cairo multiplied by a\nthousand W like I live now in Los\nAngeles and everybody in Los Angeles\n about traffic and I tell them if\nyou haven't been to Cairo you haven't\nseen traffic and the thing is this is\nwhat we do as brown people we like to\ncompete with white people with who has\nthe biggest misery it's like oh you have\ntraffic wait listen to me you know but I\nhave to tell you after two days in New\nDelhi you\nwin we cannot compete with that kind of\ntraffic I thought it was alhamdulillah\nyou guys are amazing so it is amazing\nthat I'm here and I am very very pleased\nto be here and it's such an honor and I\ndon't know like I I thought a lot about\nhow to start my speech so I thought of\nstarting a speech of maybe like an un\nusual um way maybe quoting someone that\nyou might know and the quote goes as\nstarvation of an underfed bengalese is\nless serious than that of sturdy Greeks\nthat was Winston Churchill responding to\nthe news of millions of Indians killed\nin the Bengal famine in\n1943 Churchill was also the one who said\nI do not admit that a great wrong has\nbeen done to the red Indians of America\nor the black people of Australia I do\nnot admit that a wrong has been done to\nthese people by the fact that a stronger\nrace a higher grade race a more worldly\nwise race has come in and taken their\nplace now I know that my presence here\ncarries certain expectations of talking\nabout certain topics or might I say one\ncertain topic but it is all connected\nhuman stories across our history with\ntheir pain struggle grave injust jce are\nall connected the stories might come\nfrom different parts of the world\ndifferent eras of our past but at the\ncore they are more or less the same\nstory it's a story of who writes the\nstory who owns the narrative and who\nmanipulates the truth Winston Churchill\nwas a hero to the British Empire he is\neven considered by many as the greatest\nBritain that ever lived but for India\nand for many other ex British colonies\nhe was a racist Colonial and hateful\nenemy same goes for many European and\nAmerican politicians leaders and\nMilitary commanders all through history\nsomeone's hero is another one's Colonial\nnightmare but we don't write the story\nthey do it is also a very old and\nrepetitive story throughout history\nhumans killed other humans conquered\nhumans enslaved humans exploited humans\nfrom an evolutionary point of view we\nare animals but we don't want to feel\nlike animals I won't just get up and\nkill you in the morning who do you think\nI am an animal no I'm human I am evolved\nI only kill if I absolutely need to so I\nneed a justification you are a threat\nyou are a danger you brought it on\nyourself but most importantly you are\nnot as human as me under the Nazis\nJewish people people were called rats\nit's not that easy to put a human in a\ngas chamber but a rat put 10 put a 100\nput a million it's just a rat an animal\na subhuman lower than me you can't just\ntake another human put him in Chains\nenslave them torture them and treat them\nlike animal you need to see him as an\nanimal as a Savage as someone who\ndoesn't deserve to be human it's their\ncolor it's their primitive culture they\nare less than me you can't just starve\nor kill whole population you need to see\nthem as Unworthy of living killing\nhumans is difficult but doing it because\nof feeling Superior entitled that's easy\nin short humans have been consistent\nabout one thing and one thing alone\nbeing to other\nhumans throughout our history we killed\npeople because they had the wrong\nreligion the wrong color the wrong\nethnicity but they don't even have to be\ndifferent even with people who looked\nsounded and believed the same we like\nthe we are managed to find\nsomething anything to excuse ourselves\nfor our shitty behaviors towards others\nmaybe we can't help it maybe human\nnature is by nature a shitty nature but\nthere is the problem humans actually\nbelieve that they can do better after\nWorld War II with the formation of the\nUN and the universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and the spre of Nations\nIndependence around the world and the\nCivil Right movements and the fight for\nequality and prosperity for all we\nthought that we could evolve into better\nhumans that the atrocities that happened\nin the past will never be repeated never\nagain we are not primitive anymore we\nare not in the Dark Ages anymore we have\ndefeated colonialism racism and\nInjustice we can do better and finally\nbecome human how embarrassingly naive we\nwere we maintained our brutality but we\nbecame more creative in justifying the\n we do to other humans all because\nwe became more connected to reality you\nsee a long time ago we weren't aware of\nwhat's Happening far away from us if you\nwere a resident of ancient Athens or\nRome if you lived in Spain or Portugal\nin the 1600s if you were a citizen of\nEngland or France in the 1800s you would\nhave enjoyed a good life under the power\nof those Empires but this quality of\nlife was made possible through the\nexploitation of other nations and people\nbut the people of these Empires were too\nfar removed from the process they\nenjoyed the fruit of their nation's\ndominance without having to know how it\nhappened and what at what human cost 100\nyears ago you would have never heard\nthis in London let's have some tea it's\nfair trade no Indians were harmed in the\nprocess no people were like oh spices I\ndon't know how we got them but yeah same\nin same is true today I now live in\nAmerica which in its Spare Time invades\npeople here and\nthere and because of that we enjoy great\ndiscounts at\nCostco but now we are not that remote\nbecause of the technology that is\navailable in our hands we now have a\nfirst row seat to the killing the abuse\nand the exploitation necessary to\nprovide a life of comfort wealth and\nprosperity for the mighty and the\npowerful so now we as humans need even\nbetter\njustification more effective\ndistractions and more reasoning\nso we don't feel bad about ourselves now\nwe need a better constructed reality to\nmake us feel okay with all of this an\nalternative reality or in layman terms\npropaganda but this despite our progress\nand despite our elaborate propaganda our\njustifications to kill others remain the\nsame they are savages terrorists they\nare coming for us they have wmds boom\nlet's invade Iraq or like how Isis\ndecided that the rest of us are infidels\nheathens and that God gave them the\nright to kill other men and enslave\ntheir women or when Israelis feeling\nthat because they were God chosen people\nthey can kill others that God didn't\nchoose here is the thing with\npropaganda you\ncannot refute propaganda with just facts\nand Truth propaganda is meant to make\nyou emotional to make you have a\nvisceral reaction the lies have to be so\nelaborate in order to prevent you from\nusing common sense they distract you\nthrow you off balance ignore reality and\nmake you focus on what they want you to\nfocus on before I took the stage they\nplayed a video of my interview with P\nMorgan talking about the war in Gaza I\nwas put in a position to defend people\nwho were vilified while being\nslaughtered because the Israeli\npropaganda made Millions believe that\nthese people deserve to die they did it\nthrough lies propaganda twisting facts\nand emotional blackmail in these\nsituations the truth doesn't work facts\ndon't work you need to destroy\npropaganda in a way that is slick and\neffective suddenly satire comes in handy\nhow many people should we kill as many\nas we can but Israel is warning\ncivilians before bombing them very very\ncute all I did was regurgitate their\ntalking points to them to make them see\nhow stupid they are propaganda is not\njust about lies it's about distraction\njust take a small sample of the cliches\nthey use in order to divert the\nconversation I'm sure you heard these\none after the other what is a\nproportionate response does Israel have\nthe right to defend itself do you\ncondemn Hamas does Israel have the right\nto exist October 7th decapitated babies\nbabies babies women were raped babies\nwere put in the oven they are killing\nbabies October 7th October 7th why don't\nthe Arab take in the Palestinians where\nis the outrage when Muslims kill other\nMuslims why don't you talk about Syria\nLibya Sudan Yemen October 7th you are\nanti-semitic you are a Jew hater you are\na terrorist sympathizer do you condemn\nHamas October 7th October 7th we will\ntalk about everything except the killing\nthat is happening every day as we sit\nhere discussing talking\npoints this style of distraction is\ninspired by a very old debating trick\ncalled Gish Galloping Gish Galloping is\na way where one side throws distraction\nlies and have Truth at you in order to\nconfuse you distract you away from the\nreal issues we have seen this on display\nevery day since the war started his only\nstarted on October 7th we are not\nallowed to talk about what came before\nyou criticize Israel you want cease fire\nyou HTE the Jews what about the\ndecapitated babies so now they shut down\nthe conversation they turn it emotional\nvisceral but I don't blame them they do\nwhat other countries do they lie they\nlie and they lie and they lie and they\nlie and when you think they are done\nthey go like DJ khed another one no I\ndon't blame them I blame the media the\nsame media that gave us lectures and\nhistory lessons about transparency\nhonesty journalistic integrity and\nholding people accountable the\ndecapitated babies the gang rape Stories\nthe babies in ovens these were lies that\nhave been refuted by the Israeli media\nthemselves none of the western media\nOutlets retracted retracted any of those\nstories with the proper apologies hours\nno days days were dedicated to the most\nobscene outlandish stories and no one\nsaid sorry guys we messed up the Israeli\nmedia talked extensively about the\nHannibal directive and how a huge\nportion of Israeli civilians were killed\nby not so friendly fire CNN BBC nothing\nthey were busy publishing headlines like\n15 people were killed in Gaza killed by\nwho we don't know how are they killed we\ndon't know they have been doing this\nforever one of my favorite Headlines by\nthe New York Times is from\n2014 when Israel fired a missile killing\nfive people in a coffee shop in Gaza and\nthe headline came as missile finds\npatrons at\nCafe how did it find them we don't know\nwhat would have happened if it never\nfound them we have no idea or when the\nWall Street Journal just a few weeks ago\nin October published this\nheadlines\nblast goes off at Orthodox Church in\nGaza yes there was a miracle blast that\nmiraculously happened you don't believe\nin miracles come on it actually happened\nin a church miracles do happen the\nWestern media that has been lecturing us\nabout the dangers of using religion and\nHoly scripture to justify political\nactions and launching Wars those same\npeople have no problem talking about the\nhistorical claims of the chosen people\nand their indisputable right in the\npromised land really chosen people\nchosen by whom promised promised by whom\nGod your God my God who God we don't\nknow it is funny how the West uses\nreligion as it pleases they ridicule and\ncriticize brown people religions at will\nyour religion is violent your religion\nis nonsense your religion is ridiculous\nSavage primitive you can't take\npolitical decisions just because your\nscripture tells you so and yet they open\nly talk about God choosing certain\npeople to do whatever the hell they want\nand I and and this is where I get\nconfused if they really believe in this\nthis whole thing about chosen people\nthen why don't they just all convert to\nJudaism if you believe that they are the\nchosen people won't you feel left out\nwon't you feel\nunchosen I mean the hypocrisy we are the\nWest we are secular we are liberal we\ndon't care about\nreligion but when it comes to Israel\nSuddenly It's biblical by the way the\nlies and the false justification that\nhave been used to kill other people and\nwiping out whole communities have been\nrecycled over and over again 1898 the\nWilmington Massacre 1906 the Atlanta\nMassacre 1912 fory country Massacre 1921\nthe Tulsa Massacre 1922 Perry Florida\n1923 Rosewood Florida 1931 the Scots B\nboys trial in Alabama these were\nmassacres against black people in\nAmerica and all of them started the same\nway a rumor and allegation that some\nblack people raped or assaulted white\nwomen that gave white Americans an\nexcuse to kill torture Lynch and even\nburn down whole communities displacing\nthem destroying their homes hospitals\nand schools Collective punishment\ngendered accusations and displacement\nbased on false rumors sounds familiar\nthey even still use the same kind of\naccusation whenever people speak against\nInjustice when some people try to\nsupport the black community in their\nplight for justice and equality they\nwere called race traitors self-hating\nwhites self-hating Americans same as we\nsee today when Jewish people stand up\nagainst Israeli war crimes they are\ncalled self-hating Jews and it doesn't\nmatter how Jewish you are the co-author\nof the universal Declaration of Human\nRights Steven Hessel was a Jew he was a\nholocaust Survivor he was part of the\nFrench Resistance against the Nazis when\nhe stood up for Palestinian rights he\nwas called an\nanti-semite just like that together with\nmany Jewish people including politicians\ncomedians actors X IDF soldiers who\nrejected Zionist lies and even rabbis\nthey too were called self-hating Jews\nand anti-semites it's the best way to\nshut down the\nconversation I got a taste of that\nmyself because my oos against them they\nnow call me a jewter an anti-semite and\na secret member of the Muslim\nBrotherhood but I'm used to that in\nEgypt 13 years ago when I hosted my\npolitical satire show and because of my\nreviews I was called an Infidel a\ntraitor a Freemason a secret Jew an\nunderground mad agent and my absolute\nfavorite I was called a CIA operative\nwho has been recruited by John Stewart\nto use satire to bring down the\ncountry\nI'm running out of countries and I'm\nrunning out of\naccusations yes satire is a huge threat\nto propaganda because those who\nmanipulate people and bl blackmail them\nthrough lies and fear they know that\nsatire is their Kryptonite because when\nyou laugh at someone you are not afraid\nof them anymore when you ridicule their\nlies they have no legs to stand on and\nwhen you use common sense lace with a\nlittle bit of humor their talking points\nself- implode they don't want you to\ncall them out cuz if you do you will\nruin whatever they have to be trying to\nachieve stripping Palestinians away from\nHumanity painting them as terrorists\nSavages and monsters so everyone can\nfeel better killing them they act like a\ntypical narcissist every time you expose\nthem when they they're like how dare you\nruin my reputation by telling people\nwhat I actually do Americans did that\nwith black people Britain did that with\nIndians the West did that with Iraq lies\npropaganda and dehumanization but to be\nfair it is not just white people doing\nit to brown people and black people\nbrown and black people dehumanize others\ntoo at certain point of History we were\ncruel and violent against other people\nhuman history is just one big abusive\ntoxic relationship but it just happens\nthat now white people rule the planet\nand they do that with the very advanced\ntechnology and very scary weapons so the\ndestruction and the decimation are much\nmore pronounced and the killing is much\nmore effective today I don't have to\ndrive my sword into your body to kill\nyou I can just sit behind the screen\npush a button and blow your whole block\nup advanced technology allowed humans to\nbe more removed and more lethal while\nbeing conveniently away from the\nBloodshed how many times did you hear\nthem brag about bombing their enemies\nback to the stone ages killing them like\nanimals but there's a problem when you\ntreat people like animals animals is\nwhat you going to\nwhen someone attacks another one with a\nknife it's terrorism but if I fly\ncomfortably in my $64 million F16\npushing a button to drop a 16,000 a84\nmulti-purpose bomb on a residential\nblock killing 200 people that's not\nterrorism that is war those are just\ncollateral damages sad and inevitable\noutcome of War we have gotten so\ncomfortable killing people from afar\nfrom behind screens treating them like\nSavages they they behind fortified walls\nit's easy and convenient but here's the\nproblem when that screen is removed when\nthe Fortified walls get breached you\nwill find yourself face to face with\nwhat with what you have created you bomb\nthem to the Middle Ages then middle-age\nbrutality is what you're going to get\nyou treat them like Savages they will\nattack you like Savages despite all that\nI still consider myself very fortunate\nliving in today's world I of marveled at\nour human ability to innovate and create\na better life that is easy convenient\nand even at sometimes very entertaining\nbut I'm also scared of our own ability\nto hate discriminate and\nself-destruct I hope that we truly\nevolve to understand that we are all the\nsame I wish that we can understand that\nno matter how much we think we can be\npowerful enough to abuse exploit and\nkill other people what we are really\ndoing is killing our own Humanity I wish\nthat the leaders we celebrate would be\nleaders who help lift All Humans help\nall humans be good to All Humans not\njust leaders who acquire their Fame and\nstatus from using and abusing a group of\npeople from the benefit of their own and\nspeaking of leaders and in closing\nthere's just one thing left for me to\nsay Winston Churchill thank you\nvery\n[Applause]\nmuch\nwe can they just need a minute to change\nthis up so we get we'll both get mics\nfor the well you know we can we can talk\nlike this until they do the not to K\nthem with Hello can we just do it like\nthis yeah yeah okay so you've given us a\nwhole lot to think about uh bassim we\ndidn't expect uh anything less but I'm\ngoing to start off with what you started\nwith and how you ended I'm not going to\nrepeat the words but beep Winston\nChurchill is something that uh I dare\nsay would get a rise out of most Indians\nso you've uh warmed yourself to all\nIndians by saying that about Winston\nchurch but why uh why did you think that\nuh you know talking about Winston\nChurchill and the British would get\neveryone's blood up well because we it's\na very provocative thing and it's a it's\nsomething that a lot of people relate to\nin this country well because we we\nbasically I I said before Egypt and\nIndia India is like Egypt but multiply\nby a thousand we were also occupied by\nthe British for a very long time and we\nunderstand how what is the meaning of\nbeing looked down and what's the meaning\nof actually being discriminated against\nbeing looked down as a lower race\nbecause they think they are better and\nthey have the right to exploit our\nriches and our resources because they\nare entitled to do that and while they\nare heroes in their own land they they\nthey do that on the expense of our own\npeople and our own resources so I\nunderstand how you feel and I kind of\nlike I felt kind of a a more of a\ncomraderie with with Indians in this\nparticular matter uh you know I wanted\nto talk about anti-Semitism uh now basam\nbecause that's uh uh that's something\nthat you're attacked with a lot you're\ncalled a Jew hater you're labeled as\nanti-semitic uh you know people are\nunwilling to listen to anything you have\nto say sometimes because they say no the\nplace he's coming from is anti-Semitism\nand that's one of the themes that you\njust touched upon right now when you\nwhen you talked about how all these\nthings are thrown at you so that the\nessence of what you want to say is\ndiluted or diverted from how do you you\nknow how do you respond when people call\nyou a Jew hater or an anti-em well\nhere's the thing the the accusation of\nanti-Semitism is a very dangerous\naccusation no one should ever be hated\nor discriminated against because of\ntheir ethnicity and religion but the way\nthat it's been used and overused and\nabused it's being used in a way to shut\ndown conversation everybody's an\nanti-semite and it's been so overused\nthat it doesn't mean anything anymore\nyou know it's like you know when you\nwhenever you call everybody islamophobe\nislamophobe islamophobe you know people\nsay okay I'm an islamophobe what you\ngoing to do right I don't believe the\nway that when you throw accusations and\npeople in to to shut down the\nconversation they just um um Jonathan\nGlazer he was like an Israeli Jewish\ndirector he won an Oscar for his movie\nabout the Holocaust and what because he\nrefused to have his Jew Jewish faith to\nbe used an excuse to kill other people\nhe was called an anti-semite so if you\noveruse a certain accusation it means\nnothing it means nothing anymore it's\nlike you want to call me an antisite\ncall me I don't care but the thing is\nhere's the thing even in India even in\nAmerica even in Egypt the way that\npeople use like oh you you hate your\ncountry you hate your religion you're\nnot Indian enough you're not Egyptian\nenough you're not American enough you\nself you're a self-hating American\nyou're self-hating Egyptian self-hating\nIndian this is a way in order to create\nthis viseral emotional blackmail so\npeople would be scared to speak up so I\nthink this what happened is good because\nwe need to speak up because they cannot\nuse these empty accusations against us\nanymore because if they use that this\ngoing to be the first step to shut down\nthe conversation and do whatever the\nhell they want without and while you\nbeing afraid to speak up being called a\nself-loathing Indian is very much part\nof the conversation here in India as\nwell so we know what you're talking\nabout but you know but the thing is that\nI'm sure that the people who a lot of\npeople who been called self-loathing\nIndians are people who criticize what's\nhappening in India out of love the\npeople who actually criticize things in\ntheir own country on their own religion\nit becomes it if I don't care about my\ncountry I will not criticize what's\nhappening right or if if I'm complicit\nin what's happening why would I\ncriticize and again as you said\nself-loathing indiian self-hating Jew\nself-hating American it is the same\nexact way and strategy in order to shut\ndown conversation uh you know many of\nthe things you've spoken about are\nextremely evocative and the parallels\nyou've drawn are themes that resonate\nwith us as Indians as well you know from\nyour Egyptian experience and I just\nwanted to quickly tell our audience here\nbecause I was approached by many people\nuh raise your hands if you have a\nspecific question for basam you you can\nask him he will answer you we've got\nabout 25 more minutes so I have a few\nquestions so until I uh we pass some\nmics around if you raise your hand I'll\nsee you uh okay yeah over there but\nbefore before you I'm going to quickly\nask one question since you talked about\nuh\nBasim elaborate lies propaganda as you\nknow subtle elaborate lies it's not loud\nit's it's Insidious it's it's subtle you\ndon't really know it when it's happening\nwhat's the most elaborate lie currently\nin your view in my view yeah in your\nview well there's a lot of them like uh\nI mean the whole thing about the\npropaganda that there was like gang\nraping of women and decapitated babies\nand the Israeli media itself has refuted\nthese claims Time After Time After Time\nAfter Time and that's why I used the\nexample from the black history uh\nAfrican-American history in America\nbecause they would use that in order to\nkill and decimate whole Community I\ndon't know if you know about that uh\nabout Tulsa Raaz in Tulsa in Oklahoma\nthere was a very prominent and very\nlavish black community they had a good\nbusinesses they were they were like\ngrazing up in the in the in the socio\neconomic ladder and just because of a\nlie that some black uh person assaulted\na a white woman in an elevator their\nwhole District was was burned out in\nAtlanta it happened the same and they\neven pushed them and displaced them into\na smaller place in the middle of Atlanta\nso that's why it is this kind of ways in\norder to use a very very elaborate lies\nin order to kill people okay uh we've\ngot a question over there this guy this\nguy did it first okay okay there first\nand then\nyou yeah go\nahead promoting me up the order sir so\nwhile I very much enjoy saaya myself\nwhile I thank you for promoting me of\nthe order while I very much enjoy Satia\nmyself um Malcolm Gladwell hosted a\npodcast\nwhere he said that Satia often misses\nthe mark because a lot of the audience\ntakes it literally they don't know\nyou're joking have you ever faced this\nproblem and do you have a view on Satia\nthank you oh oh absolutely even\nespecially in the Arab world a lot of\npeople um mix satire with\ndisrespect if you joke about something\nyou're disrespecting me and this comes\nfrom an authoritarian mind because if I\nin a in a in a place of authority you\ndon't have the right to De criticize me\nit is kind of like the Father Figure man\nI'm your father father how come that you\ncriticize me and that works in families\nbut that doesn't work in politics\nbecause in politics you're an elected\npolitician it doesn't matter how old or\nhow respectful you're not my father you\nare there to make to do a job for me I\nmean this is this is the idea of a\npublic servant so when you criticize\nusing satire it is a way of freedom of\nexpression but people in order they shut\ndown the conversation they call you\ndisrespectful they call they even use\nreligion in order to discredit you so of\ncourse I it doesn't satire doesn't miss\nthe mark people who criticize it they\nmiss the mark do they say why are you\nmaking fun of a serious issue oh yeah\nall the time yeah yeah right um basam\nyeah um humor me a little um you haven't\nspoken about your Terror past your\nconnection with terrorists back home why\ntell us all also you criticize the west\nbut when you were to flee Egypt you\nlanded in the great us of absolutely\nabsolutely well here's the thing I\ncriticize a country that I wanted to be\nbetter I tried that with my country and\nI failed now I'm in a new country that's\nwhy I don't want to be running out of\ncountries well here the thing this this\nis like a very I I actually I like that\nyou asked this because this is exactly\nwhat a white person would tell me it's\nlike if you criticizing the West why are\nyou staying there this is exactly what\nthey say right but the thing is we go to\nthe don't insult me by calling me white\nno of course not I said like one but\nlike um but here's the thing the way\nthat we go to the West because they are\nthey marketed their countries very well\ncome to us we have freedom of expression\nwe come and we speak up it's like no no\nno no go back to where you came from\nit's like come on come on that doesn't\nwork if you promise people to come there\nfor freedom of expression and equality\nwe go there and we take this promise and\nagain when we criticize the West we\ndon't criticize the West out of hate we\nwant it to be out of love so they will\nbe better for themselves and for the\nrest of humanity the same way that I\ncriticize my own country I don't do it\nout of hate I I don't do it out of spite\nI do it out of love in order to be\nbetter thank you speaking of uh thank\nyou Gita for that uh the land of and and\nand and also like I want to escape like\nI I wanted to play the white man game\nthey always win so I want to be on The\nWinning\nSide speaking of the land of the free\nand Home of the Brave Basim uh you've\ngot a you've got an interesting name for\nthe current president of the United\nStates genocide Joe no no no no no\ngenocide before me I added geriatric to\nthe he a geriatric genocide Biden yeah\nso we've got a you've got an election\ncoming up where uh where uh you've\ndecided to be much more against the\ncurrent president than the guy who's up\nagainst him how's that working out for\nyou well one would have imagined when it\ncomes to Trump no no I I it doesn't when\nI am against Biden it doesn't mean that\nI'm with Trump but it just like it is\nsad that like a democracy like America\ncan only produce two people that should\nbe in a nursing home you know it's just\nlike I I I think we should like this\nthis is very sad this is extremely sad\nyou know I mean they I mean I have a\njoke that I say in my my stand-up comedy\nyou know I make a joke about Trump so\nthe Trump supporters kind of get angry I\nlike guys it's not that it's just like\nit is so refreshing you know when Trump\nwas present he was in your face the\nwhole time he was all in the news but we\nnow it's so refreshing to find that to\nwake up in the morning and and and you\nknow forget you have a president and\nthen I said like even Joe Biden he wakes\nup in the morning and he forgets his\npresident so so that that that is that\nis the thing I mean the whole idea of\nlook look at it from a business point of\nview how many how many oil companies you\nhad in the past and how many oil\ncompanies you have now how many uh\nweapons country uh armed companies we\nhad in the past now they're all they\nused to have like about\n53 uh companies now they are\nConsolidated in five this kind of\nMonopoly consolidating power in a very\nfew hands like consolidating power in\nonly two parties these are not the two\nbest candidates in America these are the\nbest these are the candidates that are\npromoted by those two parties\nconsolidating power in the hand of very\nfew is very dangerous it's dangerous to\neconomy it's like Monopoly and it's\ndangerous for politics and danger for\nfreedom of expression so this is when\nwhen you when you say that you do not\naccept what is happening it doesn't mean\nthat you support trump it means that you\nare against the discourse that\nthis that the Democratic process has\ntaken and I think that United States\ndeserve much better than this well this\nisn't going to happen Bim but if you\nwere moderating the presidential debate\nbetween Biden and Trump this year what\nwould you say to both by way of\nintroduction what would you say to both\nyou can say you can spend 30 seconds\nsaying something to both Biden and Trump\nwhat would you say to them\nuh please welcome a mad man and a\ngenocide man he's like this is this is\nlike the this is the problem with the\nchoices that we have like I was just\nlike please please I like please welcome\nthe only two choices that we have that\nwe shouldn't be ending with that is\nbasically that we should presentent them\nwith okay yeah go ahead yeah hi B uh my\nquestion is like you know it's uh when\nyou when anyone does comic and satire it\nis pretty much a creative work so my\nquestion is uh like when you do so for\nthe darker side of life for a war or for\nfor so many negative things happening\naround the world how do you prepare\nyourself I mean what's your creative\nprocess behind it before you do a satire\nshow what is the creative process of\nwriting uh comedy for satire and comedy\nof the darker subjects yeah I go into a\nperiod of\ndepression and then I I end up with some\nsuicidal thoughts and this process of\nself cleansing and the need to to\nexterminate yourself accompanied by me\nbeing in my and coming to become 50 and\nin my midlife crisis so that all creates\na great environment for dark\nsatire thank you thank you so much thank\nyou you I I want to return to that uh uh\nyou know video I we've got a still image\nfrom the pi Morgan uh uh conversation\nthat you had that uh went so incredibly\nviral what happened immediately after\nthat bus I you know because you have you\nwent and did another longer piece with\nwith peers that was in LA uh but in the\nimmediate aftermath of that of that you\nknow incredible incredible piece with uh\nwith Pierce for the first time uh what\nhappened immediately after that what\nchanged for you oh my life changed\nforever apart apart from your enormously\nbigger fan base and audience what\nchanged for you well there is of course\nthere are some positive changes because\nsuddenly uh a lot of Arabs came to me\nand they're Arabs in politics and they\nsaid that it's kind of like open the\ndoor for them to speak because a lot of\npeople are afraid to speak up so but\nwhat happened to me is that I lost a\ncouple of jobs in Hollywood and I I\nactually gained a lot of of of work too\nand it seems that it was the best\nrepresentation of how you could be\ndropped by The Establishment by chosen\nby the people because in life life\ncomedy and life audience you don't have\nto go through a middleman you don't have\nto go through a studio you people come\nand they pay the ticket to see you so\nit's more of like a vote of people more\nthan just like you having to go by the\nwhat the establishment says got a\nquestion from there uh thank you for the\nhonesty we have very similar views about\nMr Churchill um I feel the conversation\ngoing to get that a lot believe me thank\nyou I'm I'm I'm I'm very happy that I\nthat I I touch a nerve thank you I I\nfeel the conversation may be a bit\nincomplete till we don't hear a few\nminutes about your views about Mr Putin\nlike just I feel that that also may be\nincluded in the conversation what Putin\nwhat do you feel about Mr Putin what the\nRussian guy Putin Putin oh Putin yeah\nbut how do I feel about Putin what do\nyou feel about Putin what do you think\nabout Putin I I think there's an\nauthoritarian dictator same it's not\nit's it's like here's the thing when you\ncriticize a certain side it doesn't mean\nthat you like the other side I mean the\nfact that like these are the choices\nthat are giving on both sides doesn't\nmake it right but I don't I I think like\nPutin is dictator um and I but I think\nand I think America in itself is going\nto in its own way of becoming what we\ncall um not a it's more of an oligarchy\nbecause the problem with here's the\nthing you can talk about Putin and\nRussia but like it's he does what he's\nexpected to do to be an authoritarian to\nbe a brutal dictator but America that\nmarkets itself as a democracy has been\nnow turning very very slowly to an\noligarchy because all of the politicians\nare being bought by special interest\ngroups whether by it's like certain\nlobbies or certain gun or uh gun groups\nor certain U groups that follows the\nmilitary industry complex or the\npharmaceutical company so you end up\nvoting for people you have the illusion\nof freedom of expression and you vote\nfor someone and that someone doesn't\nrepresent your your interest he\nrepresents whoever pays him in order to\ncarry his campaign so like about Putin I\nmean there's nothing really to be said\nabout like he's a classic classical\nbrutal dictator but you know I'm more\nconcerned about the people who call\nthemselves the leaders of the Free World\nwho Market themselves at the at the\nBeacon of democracy you need to step up\nfor what you are you are talking\nabout Western hypocrisy uh is is another\ntheme that resonates with us here in\nIndia uh especially the Western press\nyou know you took the names of certain\nnewspapers and Publications and those\nvery frequently become trigger points uh\nhere uh in India as\nwell you you know you often say Basim\nimagine if Israel was Russia would the\nPress be looking at it the same way can\nyou expand on that a little bit what\nhappens when you say that because you\nsee you've given us examples of how the\nWestern press reports on Israel you took\nthose very uh you know resonant examples\nof the headlines they gave for that bomb\nthat went off in a church in Gaza uh and\nyou constantly say what if Israel was\nactually Russia the Contex of what's\nhappening in UK or Ukraine Ukraine but\nthe thing is when you say that they tell\nyou how how dare you compare them you\nknow they don't even want to even start\nthe comparison it's like oh that's\nthat's different it's and and and this\nis this is where the hypocrisy is very\napparent because they do not they always\ntalk about Israel right to exist what\nabout Palestinians right to exist they\ntalk about their right to defend them\nthemselves what about Palestinian right\nto defend itself and it doesn't mean\nthat when I talk about that that I\nsupport Hamas but this is how they want\nto to kind of conclude the conversation\nthey want to put you in that corner\nright you you can talk and criticize\nHamas as much as you want but Hamas is a\nproduct for what happened by Israel for\nyears and years and years and years so\nyou cannot really separate them both got\na question back there yeah the the lady\nin the glasses back there they're I'm\ncoming to\nyou first of all thank you so much for\num sharing with all of us that there was\nno romantic golden age in the past we\ncome from great stocks of looking\nfor equally crappier future but in times\nlike this when it is so dark um what\ngives you hope that is if you still\nhopeful what gives you hope is the new\ngeneration I mean I think it was very\napparent in the past few months how the\nnewer generation who were not been\nfollowing the Legacy Media that they\nformed their own media their own\nresearch I myself have learned so much\nfrom younger people doing research and\ndeun debunking lies and propaganda that\nhave for years and years and years and\nyears the younger people the young Basha\nyes thank you the younger people who who\nhave now like taken over Tik Tok and\ntaken over the social media explaining\nthings to us that this Legacy Media\ndidn't do for us so maybe my hope is\nthat that new generation who have their\nown way of of of of acquiring\ninformation that having his their own\nway of of uh uh of knowing the truth and\nthat is like the thing that gave me hope\nmaybe the New Generation that we\ncriticize and we make fun of because\nthey're on Tik Tok the whole time maybe\nthere's something that we don't see that\nthey will come and surprise us is that\nan opportunity basam I want to explore\nthat for a moment uh before I come to\nyou is that an opportunity with this new\ngeneration rejecting Legacy Media you\nknow forming their own opinions doing\ntheir own research uh you know but the\nbut the the cycle of violence the circle\nof War continues why isn't that an\nopportunity for things to actually\nchange because they don't have the power\nbut power is still in the hand of the\nOld Guard because the geriatrics are\ndying they have to die because no\nthey're D no they don't have to die we\nneed to put them in a nursing home but\nit's not that it's just like I think it\nis it we have a great opportunity in the\nfuture for those younger people\nhopefully when they come to the position\nof power they can actually make change\nand maybe it is what what we have seen\nin the past few months that was as\nbrutal as it was it gives us hope in a\nnew generation that we never thought\nthat would perform that\nwell yeah\nhi um my name viaga uh I think you and I\nthink everyone might believe that\nwhatever we think and we talk much that\nwill happen or maybe manifest right uh\nwe we are the normal people human beings\nright we don't like Wars we don't like\nany negative things right I know this is\nnot your good for your business you\nguys' business maybe but I think if you\nwant to remove these kind of negative\nthings of War right we have to stop the\nI believe\nthe only way to stop something is to\nstart uh stop talking about those topics\nright if you keep on topping something a\nnegative or anything of war and not\nabout you I'm just talking very general\nright uh that is I think that is the\nonly way to stop the negative thing\nright otherwise we manifest more and\nmore all right let's follow your advice\nand let's talk about everything bad\nhappens in the world and see let's give\nit a\nweek I mean I think this is a very nice\nand spiritual way to speak about things\nbut I think that doesn't work because\nthe only way things change is actually\nyou talk about them I understand that\ntalking about them are noisy and\ndisturbing you know as they say\ndemocracy is very noisy democracy is\nvery uh it's a very noisy place because\nyou have to listen to you have\nto listen to horrible things but that is\nhow things change you talk about things\nyou don't hide in the hide your head in\nthe sand and not talk about it hoping\nfor it to go away that that's my simple\nreaction speaking about war G just\nbefore I come to you I have a quick\nquestion and I must ask this since since\nthe gentleman here talked about you know\nhow to stop War uh I must ask you\nbecause this is something you probably\nare asked Bas which is as far as Israel\nand Palestine are concerned it's been\ngoing on for so long cycles of violence\nkeep coming\nup how does it end what needs to happen\nfor it to end you're asking me I'm\nasking you this is a 75 years conflict\nthat Scholars and politicians and\nNations fail to stop that that's\nprobably why maybe it needs a\ncomic it it comes down to\njustice justice fair to be fair and to\ngive people what they deserve you cannot\nexpect to come and replace a whole\npopulation take their land and then\nexpect them to go and die silent and\ndisappear into the night I mean it\nhappened before it happened with a\nNative Americans it happened with the\naboriginals in Australia but 50 million\nnative amans were killed 20 million\nAboriginal killed in Australia but the\nthing is we don't live in 1400s anymore\nwe live now we see that what happens day\nto day and you cannot just like\nannihilate a whole people or expect to\ndisplace 7 million people outside of a\ncertain land and they expected to go\naway like if we really believe in our\nability to be humans and to change\nthings we cannot allow the mistakes of\nthe past to keep repeating because it\njust happened\nbefore G almost out of time so yeah\nthank you shf for a second chance I\ncan with you here's the white woman\nagain the white woman again uh basam yes\nyou have turned a very dark age or or\nstage in in our history uh into u a lot\nof people to ponder upon but also\nbrought it to the four through your\nhumor but it's about content generation\nwhere are you getting this content from\nwhat is just give us one glimp of your\nconversation with your loser cousin back\nhome or back in Gaza uh your\nbrother-in-law in Gaza uh what's a\nconversation that you have and uh how do\nyou pick up content from that what\nconversation do I have with the with\nwith your loser cousin or your loser\nbrother-in-law by the way my loser\nbrother-in-law is not actually a loser\nhe's a doctor and I will tell you\nsomething come on don't break my heart\ndon't I don't need those no no wait wait\nwait and Basim is a surgeon by the way\nfor those who don't know I used to be a\nheart surgeon yes I I used to be I used\nto be a doctor so that makes me\npractically an Indian\nso I know like you know I know guys you\nknow like I go I tell everybody you know\nwe have one of India's top doctors\nsitting right there Dr Nish IO her like\nokay guys if anybody have a\nheadache I I I tell people I tell people\nin my\nshow you know like I the only reason I\nbecame a doctor\nis because in the Middle East you're\nexpected to be one of three things a\ndoctor an engineer or a disappointment\nso I've been living my life as a\ndisappointment now for 13\nyears so uh so back to my loser cousin\nhere's the thing about my loser cousin\nuh I made that joke about him in the PE\nMorgan show I told him my loser cousin\nhe he's not even good enough to be a\nhuman shield you know and um and I told\nmy wife if to can can you please like\nyou know send him a message that like\nI'm sorry I made fun of him but like and\nyou know what happened she sent him a\nmessage 3 days later he responded he\nsaid like show what show TV what TV we\ndon't have Internet and then he said oh\nbass him oh we love him let him say\nwhatever they want this is how they act\nthis is how they act even in the middle\nof the war and the thing is uh all of\nthe the their family the cousins and the\nuncles there will all spread around Gaza\nand now they are being pushed to RAF and\nthey all all of them lost their homes\nthey are talking about like 18 people 18\nfamilies and they live now in one\napartment and that apartment is in a\nbuilding that could be bombed right now\nas we speak and all because these\nfreaking lies that they were repeating\nin order to justify the killing of\nmillions of people while the the West is\nsitting there wasting our time in\n discussions what's a\nproportionate response seriously are you\n seriously asking this question\nwhat's the proportion this this question\nhas should have been stopped by the\nsecond day of the war because what is\nhappening there is an continuous\nonslaught of killing innocent people\nusing shits and the Western\nmedia is complicit because they are\nwasting time by distracting you with\nuseless questions right and this is the\nway this is this is the way that the\ntheir discussion ends to Nowhere they\njust want to give you the illusion of\nthe freedom of discussion where they\nonly waste your time where they letting\nthem do whatever they\nwant we're almost out of time uh there's\na question question that uh and I'm not\nsaying this because I I work for the\nIndia Today group but basam you'll be\nhappy to know that uh when uh when the\nIND today group sent me and some of my\ncolleagues uh to Israel last year to\ncover what happened after October the\n7th we were the first Network that not\nonly reported from Israel but also went\ninto the Palestinian territories and\ntold both sides of the story so we\nbrought both sides of the story uh to\nthis entire thing so uh I just wanted to\nplace that on the record because it's\nimportant as far as the media is\nconcerned War report is a difficult job\nand the India Today group has definitely\nshown the way as that as far as that is\nconcerned no no here's the thing because\nyou guys know what it means to be\ndehumanized you guys know what it means\nto be ruled by Ruthless People who\ndehumanize you and look down upon you\nthat is why in America the people who\nsupport the Palestinian rights are\nAfrican-Americans because they have been\nthrough that they have been through that\npain and they know and we know and you\nknow when they do that with all of their\nlike very elegant suits and very nice\nlooks and makeup they do that behind a\nfacade that is actually full of lies so\nwe understand it's we expect nothing\nless than you and also I want to thank\nthe amazing stuff of India today I want\nthey were amazing and I have to\napologize to them because behind their\nback I sneaked out from my room today at\n3:00 in the morning and I went to T\nMahal and I came back right and they\nwere like please don't go please don't\ngo but like you there's a lot of traffic\nso I went at 3:00 in the morning with\nMahal and I came here in time and and I\nsaid like how like we need to lock you\nin the room it's like I escaped from\nEgypt do you think that a palace can\ncontain\nme so I apologize if I I gave you guys\nsome minimum heart attack you have a\ndoctor here who can take care of you I\nforgot everything about medicine call\n911 but

years so thank you very much\nand and while wishing you a very happy\nbirthday in advance Basim I just want to\ntell everyone here that uh some people\nmay want to label you as the John\nStewart of the Arab world but I think\nall of us here are going to remember you\nas Basim Yousef of America thank you\nvery\nmuch thank you\nso Basim can I just request you to stay\non stage for a moment please can we have\nDr pradipta Basu head of marketing of\nradical ketan hand over a token of our\nappreciation please to\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nb a big round of applause please for\nbasam\nYousef for so patiently taking all of\nour questions and taking the time out to\njoin us here at the India today\nconclave\n[Music]\nthank you very much\nbasam as we set up for our next session\njust a quick reminder ladies and\ngentlemen that in uh the mumtaz hall\nthere's a concurrence session that's\ngoing to kick off those interested can\nplease also go there and enjoy that\nsession we're having Emily from Missour\nfrom barel vangi joining us there voice\nof the people from Airwaves 2 assembly\npromises to be an engaging session so\nyou can join us at mumtaz Hall for the\nconcurrent\n[Music]\nsession\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\nall right ladies and gentlemen our next\nsession is being god with AI one command\nof inspiration imagination and\nInnovation can I invite on stage our\nsession moderator aush eladi technology\neditor and presenter of business today\ntelevision to introduce our next set of\n[Music]\n[Applause]\npanelists\n[Music]\nhello ladies and\ngentlemen now we thought there's so much\ntalk of artificial intelligence over the\npast couple of years the seminal iPhone\nmoment for AI the reason has become so\ncommon and ubiquitous happens to be chat\nGPT that's the whole world of generative\nAI but there's so much happening and\nthere's so many questions I can see a\nbunch of question marks in the audience\nis it a boon is it a bane will it take\naway my job will it augment my job well\nthese are answers we are seeking today\nwith two very special guests and I'll\nwalk and talk you through what the\nformat of this conversation will be like\nwe believe A Little Less Conversation a\nlittle more action so my guests for the\nevening are vak venu gopalan director\nsolution Consulting Adobe\nIndia a huge round of applause\nplease and samic Roy executive director\nIndian in South Asia Microsoft India\nsamic Bak what a pleasure to have you\nwith us here at the India today conclave\nso we want to start off with giving you\nguys a visual representation of what\nartificial intelligence is all about\nthese guys are working on some of the\nmost Cutting Edge Products in the tech\nworld and I can vouch for that but we\nwant to show you maybe vak why don't you\njoin us on stage right over here and\nvery quickly tell everyone or show\neveryone what AI can potenti do a huge\nround of applause for vak venugopal\nthank you thank you a such a pleasure to\nbe here and I thought with a 5 minute\nintroduction to show you probably 15\nslides only to actually change my mind\nand show you the real stuff what is\ngenerative AI all about how does it look\nlike at Adobe we have been working for\nmore than 10 years on AI and generative\nAi and let's see the magic of AI which\nis your imagination's new best friend if\nI can get\nmy feed in here yeah there you go let me\ngo Ahad and start with a prompt which\nis let's say as you can see a very busy\nevening can you see that at the bottom\nthis is Adobe Firefly and I'm going to\ngo ahead and say that let's get started\ngenerate an image based on this prompt\nin order to make it pop I have added\nstuff like bubbles and rainbows and the\nfollowing right so if I can get that\nover here yeah there you\ngo let's see what the AI is going to\nimagine about this particular prompt I\ncan always change the size of this\nparticular images as you can see I have\njust changed it to 16 by9 there you go\nthere is Rainbow there is Bubbles but I\nwant a 16 by9 so it's working on that\nand and in if the internet gods are with\nus today it should pop\nup there you go wow Bak this is all live\nimage generation I could I could type\nsomething else and it would still work\nabsolutely it's not just live image\ngeneration but all of this it's taking a\nlittle bit of time to get the fourth one\nout I hope it comes out but all of the\nimages are commercially safe for you to\nuse\nwe'll talk about that in a\nsecond what we are doing here is we are\nasking the generative AI to imagine\nabout this prompt of India Gate Bubbles\nand rainbows and flowers that's actually\nin there it doesn't stop there I can now\ntake this particular image modify let's\nsay only certain sections amplify\ncertain colors certain objects let's say\nadd more people I can do that right over\nhere if I can move back to my slides\nthere you\ngo I have a pop qu for everyone in here\nthere are four images and these are\ngenerated using the prompt\nbeautiful sunset at the\nbeach there are four Images pop quiz\nwhich one do you think is an\noriginal okay quick show of hands image\nnumber one is that original or AI\ngenerated one so is is one AI generated\nokay there's one hand what about image 2\nis that AI\ngenerated m a lot of uh smartphone\ncamera enthusiasts here what about image\n3 is that AI generated yes yes and the\nlast one image four any any show of\nhands all\nright H my apologies I didn't want to\npull a fast one on you the fact is all\nfour of them are generated by J the\npoint I want to make here is that it's\nindis distinguishable from the work that\nyou would literally take a camera and\nshot a picture versus what is generated\nby generative AI is that good is that\nbad it's a little bit of both it is good\nbecause it amplifies the creative\nproduction Cycles if you are generating\nfive images today probably you can\ngenerate 50 with the same time because\nthat is what is needed in the creative\neconomy the India as a creative economy\nwe need to produce faster more efficient\ncreative content and that's what we at\nadobi strive to actually achieve supera\nthank you so much thank you so much why\ndon't you join me here and samic over to\nyou are you going to level up on what\nvak just did right\nnow thank\nyou good afternoon if you can just\nslightly switch to my\nslide\nfirst this image was generated by\nco-pilot in less than 15 seconds so let\nme start by asking all of you a question\nhow many of you raise of hands have used\nchat\nGPT W beautiful corre how many of you\nhave heard of\nco-pilot ah lovely I have some work to\ndo okay now the very fact that most of\nyour hands were up for the first\nquestion talks about the fact that the\nerror of AI is here if you all heard the\nleaders of the world economic Forum at\nDeVos they clearly said that the planet\nis entering the Next Generation and this\nis the generation being led by AI it's\ngoing to impact every individual it's\ngoing to impact teams it's going to\nimpact organizations if used in the\nright manner positively and all of that\nwill actually help to build the economy\nof the\ncountry when we talk of AI there are\nthree aspects which we need to keep in\nmind One is using the AI as it is out of\nthe box within the products so when I\nask the question how many of you have\nheard of co-pilots or use co-pilots I\nsaw 50 40% of the hands going up that's\nco-pilots that's using the product as it\nis AI Leed a digital assistant within\nthe product and I will demonstrate that\nto you the other one is to use the\ntechnology and the platform and the\nmodels to build AI in the way it will\nhelp you work in an organization it can\nbe on any aspects you know tell me what\nthe forecast should be tell me based on\nthis how much should the production be\ntell me how much of ordering should I I\nneed to do okay tell me whether I should\napprove or disapprove this particular\nclaim tell me whether this is a\nfraudulent uh loan or not and while\ndoing all of this the third very\nimportant aspect is ethical AI or\nresponsible AI but let me just very\nquickly try and demonstrate what all AI\ncan do for you now this is a very simple\naspect you can today ask AI to help you\nfix a bulp because AI can see it can\nread it can hear and it can talk back to\nyou so this is a capturing of a live\ndemo I just took the picture and put it\nthere and said help me fix this the\nfirst thing it did is it put a caption\nand says I have ID identified this as a\nwhite Globe lamp out there cor and the\nmoment I put this particular question\nand I say I need to change the bulb can\nyou help me do it chip very quickly\nidentifies who I am and then gives me a\nlist of instructions by one one by one\nand it's very interesting it takes care\nbecause it also says if the lamp was on\nwhile you ask me this question so please\ntake time to cool down the lamp and then\nyou as you go through it it basically\nsays that you got to take the lamp up\nunscrew the lamp and then when I ask the\nquestion it tells me to give an image of\nhow it looks like and the moment I give\nthat image of how it looks like it\nidentifies what's the kind of bulb which\ncan go inside it and gives me that and\nwhen I say these are the two bulbs which\nI have now tell me how do I fix the bulb\nand which bulb to choose it then try and\nunderstands and relates that particular\nbulb to that particular socket and says\nuse the right hand bulb because that's\nthe one which will fix it right so\nsimple it could interact with me in the\nlanguage which I wanted to interact with\nand do it let me quickly change things\nco-pilot a few of you put your hands up\nco-pilot is an AI digital assistant\nwhich is there in every solution of\nMicrosoft whether you use Windows\nwhether you use the browser Edge whether\nyou use Bing whether you use Office 365\nwhich is is a productivity Suite or a\ncollaborative Suite so let's just me\ngive you a very very simple example of\nhow it helps in day-to-day work okay so\nI write an email in the morning to a\ncouple of my team members okay and this\nemail talks about a particular aspects\nwhich I want to discuss with them I go\nand try doing my work and when I come\nback after a couple of hours I see a lot\nof people have replied on that email\nsounds familiar corre all of you have\nseen it and then you see nested emails\nyou see 17 18 emails what I do is I just\ngo to co-pilot and say summarize it for\nme and draft a response and then I can\nsay the response needs to be formal and\nit needs to be short okay and just look\nat what co-pilot does it basically\ncreates the entire response I can either\nedit it further or just keep it and send\nit so I decide the response looks good I\nsend it and the email goes out to\neverybody and you can see how there an\nemail is out there correct just think of\nit instead of going through 17 emails it\njust saves me time it's just one example\njust one simple example on how co-pilot\ncould help you with that why don't I ask\nyou the question do you use copilot I do\nuse copilot why don't you please have a\nseat a use Round of Applause for these\ntwo demos we're going to geek out a\nlittle bit right now now you guys\nanswered whether you use Chad GPT or\nGoogle b or Gemini but when you use\nthese generative AI tools how many of\nyou guys trust the results blindly show\nof hands put your hands\nup that's what we're going to get to to\nreally figure out how these models can\nbe trained on perhaps more Superior data\nsets with more safeguards checks and\nbalances but let's let's really simplify\nit Bak you actually did a live image\ngeneration if I had typed show me the\nIndia today conclave taking place in\nkittila in Finland it could have\npossibly generated something like that\nas well right here yes absolutely but\nnow tell me isn't that a concern because\nopen AI is a company that came up with\nChad GPT Dolly a big Microsoft\nconnection there as well and now they've\ncome up with Sora Sora is going to be in\nsimple words live video generation one\nminute videos putting a lot of us behind\nthe camera an out here well at least in\nin in a little bit of under a little bit\nof pressure because that's what Sora can\ndo the open AIC CTO comes out in an\ninterview yesterday day before and says\nwe're not quite sure where those images\nand videos are coming from that's a\nmatter of concern I mean are you just\npicking it off my Instagram profile my\nYouTube videos where are you getting\nthat all that data from vak where is\nAdobe getting the data yeah thank you\naish uh we firmly believe that it's\nabsolutely important to see through what\nyou're feeding the\nAI what we do is we put immense amount\nof effort due diligence Ethics Committee\nto make sure that what goes in to our\nFirefly image model is safe for use and\nall these assets that we have trained\nour AI on we have the license for them\nmhm it makes sure that whatever comes\nout of our image generation models are\nsafe to use we haven't fed any celebrity\ninto it so you will never see any\ncelebrity out of it we haven't fed\nanything not safe for work in it to it\nso you will never see anything out of\nthat so it's important to understand the\nAI that you use where have they sourced\ntheir data from and is it commercially\nsafe for all of us to use something\nMicrosoft's been right up there in the\nAI race and you guys have been doing a\nlot of work here in India as well\nexplain to us what we just discussed\nethical AI responsible AI are these just\nterms that we should be talking about or\nis there real work that's happening is\nthere practice to back this theory Sure\nso I I think you use two very very\nimportant terms and if you go back to\nthe presentation I talked about three\nimperatives of AI using AI as it is out\nof the box product like co-pilot\nbuilding AI Frameworks you using the\nmodel and across all of them is\nresponsible or ethical AI now this is a\nconstantly evolving thing as people\nlearn as well and it will change but as\nof now we believe that there are six\nprinciples which are very important in\nethical AI That's accountability\ntransparency in inclusion fairness\nscalability and privacy and security and\nthere's a lot of work which is happening\nthere are white papers which are written\nout there there are governments which\nare looking at rules and regulations\nyesterday actually the first regulation\nwas passed in Europe according and I\nmean even if you look at the dpdp bill\nthese are all aspects which are going\ntowards the right rules and regulations\nand creating the Frameworks for\ntechnology to be used in the right\npurpose now the very important aspect\nout here is is to ensure that you train\nthe model on the right set of data M and\nthat's where accountability and\nresponsibility are but how do you train\nthe model on the right set of data this\nis publicly available data you know a\nlot of the responses that come on Chad\nGPT and I'm sure people will vouch for\nthat sound like data sets of course\nwhich are trained on maybe 2022 23\nwhatever the the limitation is but\nreally Superior versions of Google\nsearch or Bing search yeah so so it's\nit's how you put the guard rails when\nyou implement the AI within your\norganization so let's say I have created\nan AI enabled interface for any consumer\nto come and interact with me and when I\ndo that I got to tell the model that you\ngot to only answer questions which are\nwithin the Reliance of the data that I'm\nfeeding you and this is the data of the\norganization so this does not go and\nbreach any any protection any privacy of\nanybody else correct so when you ask the\nquestion and you can go and try it you\nask a particular set of questions it\nwill only give you answers of that\nparticular organization ation the moment\nyou ask so can you please tell me what\nis the cost of this product of that\nparticular company it says it will give\nyou an answer to say sorry that is not\nwhat I can do so that's where\nresponsible and ethics really come in\nit's interesting because while we are\ntalking about generative AI it's not\nlike these big tech companies haven't\nfaltered right we saw what happened with\nGoogle over the past couple of weeks so\nmany biases so much Prejudice and\nlargely a lot of these tech companies\nare training these AI models which might\nbe the future of human civilization on\nWestern you know values and data sets\nand this has been an issue right even\nwhen you take a photo on on a top\nsmartphone the way it cor you know\ncorrects color for a person of color as\nopposed to a person in the west is a big\ncontentious issue in the tech\nWorld absolutely so yes there are\nchallenges which we cannot oversee right\nfirst one you mentioned which is harmful\nbias it's a real challenge right right\nand second one obviously is defects as\nwell you had a mentioned about an\nexample of that so harmful bias um I can\ngive you an example at Adobe you might\nthink yes we are a technology company of\ncourse our strength is to actually\ncreate intellectual property rights for\ntechnology for generative AI a large\npart of our Workforce who are actually\ninvolved in generative AI you think they\nare Engineers yes there are lots of\nEngineers but more than that it's the\npeople who actually make sure that there\nis due diligence done done to make sure\nthe biases are actually not influenced\nin every single step M it's a lot of\neffort but our values make sure that we\nfollow that particular Suite if you\nnotice that we were not the first one to\nget into market with the gener AI model\nbut it's important to make sure that the\nharmful biases is not perpetuating\nwhatever is being said there in the data\nset that's being followed in talking\nabout deep fakes yes uh it can sway\ndecision and there are there are real\nthreats out there for sure so I mean we\nare in an election year absolutely\nabsolutely so it's important to actually\nacknowledge that there will be always\nBad\nactors so our approach towards that is\nhow do we Empower good actors with tools\nand techniques so that before the\ncontent is consumed they know how this\ncontent was produced is it trustworthy\nhow what is the life cycle of this\nparticular content a video an image or\nwhatever that is and whether the AI has\nbeen used whether human has altered\nimages and whatnot so basically I'm sure\nyou will get this you get a nutrition\nlabel on the content before you consume\nit so that you know where this is\nsourced and what all content is actually\nin there so that's the way we look\nforward to actually fight deep fakes out\nthere okay macronutrients in the digital\nworld carbs calories fats all of that\nbut it's very interesting because the\nconversation and sometimes you know all\nof us Tech folk in the media are blame\nfor it saying this is fearmongering you\nknow we're talking about AI being a\nfear-based discourse as opposed to a\nhope based discourse right so I want to\npose this question to you samic do you\nthink it is more of a fear-based\ndiscourse now but the kind of work you\nguys are doing with the guardrails you\nguys promise it should be more of a hope\nbased discourse in light of the\nclassical argument will AI especially\nwith what open AI doing with Sora and\nGoogle's doing with some of their\nplatforms will it take away my job and\nall of us and I'm asking this\ncollectively for the entire audience and\neveryone watching at home as well yeah I\nI think your question is very valid and\nI'm sure it's it's on the minds of the\nentire audience uh but let me take a\nstep back you know this is an\ninteresting discussion which comes out\nevery single time there is an invention\nout there uh you know when steam engine\nwas invented people said oh my God\nLocomotion will take away so jobs after\nthat at the electricity got invented the\nSecond Industrial Revolution and people\nsaid oh all the manual processes are\ngoing to be uh uh now now automated and\njobs will go away then came computers\nthe Internet and people said oh now\ncomputers will take away all the jobs uh\nuh you know when e-commerce came people\nsaid the brick and motor stores will\nclose when otd came people said nobody\nwill go to Halls anymore and the film\nindustry is doomed but let's just step\nback when computers came in today is the\nwomb India is the womb of the IT\nindustry of the world it became a\nvertical and an industry and has a\nMinistry and has a significant\ncontribution to the GDP of the country\nit didn't take jobs away so it's a\nsimilar discussion right now and and and\nlook the fear is is valid but this is\nabout the elasticity of the job market\nwhat I would say is it needs Skilling\nokay and reskilling now the good part of\nAI is that it reduced uses the learning\ncurve a lot so people can learn faster\nyou know a difference between the\nprevious era and this era is in the\nprevious era we used computers and\nautomation to bring information at your\nfingertips that's what people try to do\nthey try to digitize places they try to\ndigitize people they try to digitize\ndata in this era it is about expertise\nat your fingertips so even a common\nperson by using a lot of these AI\ngenerated models can produce better\nresults so Skilling will be very very\nimportant and redeployment that's what I\nwould say yeah just just want to add to\nthat so absolutely so we also believe\nthe same which is AI and the powerful\nchild of AI which is generative AI will\nlower the floor so that more people can\nactually enter it will democratize\ncreativity right to a large extent at\nthe same time it will also Elevate the\nceiling so that we are all will be\ndriven with the help of enablement and\nand you know education as shach\nmentioned the professionals will be\nelevated to actually uplevel the quality\nof work and that is what has happened in\nany other transformational wave of\ntechnology which has come to us it has\nalways Amplified and progressed the\nhuman race in longer terms so that's\ninteresting so by that yard stick are\nyou telling me The Writers Guild on\nstrike in Hollywood or all the the\nprotesters outside Tech conferences in\nEurope whenever we visit\ndon't have Justified fears is is that\nwhat you're saying because what you're\ntrying to tell me is if you embrace it\nyou're good and then a follow-up\nquestion of that would be if you're\nembracing this AI Revolution all of us\nthen does that mean the ones that don't\nwould really be left behind in the next\n5 years or 10 years what does that mean\nfor all of us who perhaps don't want it\nand want to live under a rock because\nthat might be the one way to stay\ndisconnected yeah so the only reference\nwe have is is the history what has\nhappened with other transformational way\nof Technology right there I mean that's\nit's absolutely fine to have fears about\nit it's absolutely okay to be little shy\nfrom you know putting that into practice\nand stuff like that but you we all have\nto dip our toes in so that it benefit us\nas individuals as organization in the\nlong term we firmly believe in that and\nI'm not uh you know in any way actually\nyou know uh I don't want to actually\ndownplay the protest or the questions\nare coming up but it's important to dip\nyour toes in right now and understand\nhow this can be applied to your own life\nto actually make it progress uh you know\nprogress your businesses as as your\nindividual careers and so on and so\nforth it's important to understand it\nand embrace it so that it enables you to\nfast forward into your future we can't\nhave a conversation on AI without\neducating and entertaining everyone as\nwell so make the last ones to you this\nis a really important theme artificial\ngeneral intelligence you will hear this\nover the next few months and years AGI\nnow this is something I personally think\nif it's in the wrong hands and some will\nexplain what it is could be well\nsomething that would be a double whammy\nfor us right we could have major issues\nthis could be something which could\ndestroy everything as we know it if you\ncould explain to us very quickly what is\nartificial general intelligence and why\nshould we be worried if Sam Alman or\nElon Musk says that they have achieved\nartificial general intelligence so so I\nmean everybody is talking about\ndifferent timelines and the timelines\nare not known you know it can be a\ncouple of years it can be 5 years it can\nbe 10 years but basically the\nfundamental of this is that we will\ncreate intelligence which far\nsupersedes human intelligence so the AI\nbecomes smarter than all of us in this\nthen smarter than all of us but I will\njust step back and say see these are all\ntools and Technologies for human beings\nto use how you use a particular thing\ndepends on us at the end of the day they\nare not going to overtake us right uh\nand that's where it comes back to\nethical AI it comes back to responsible\nAi and as I said these are evolving\nthings as you discover new things\nthere'll be new guardrails there'll be\nnew rules there'll be new regulations\nthat will come in okay uh I mean just\nlook at chat GPT it took three months 3\nmonths to reach a 100 million users\nworldwide 3 months just to give you a\nperspective internet took 7 years and\nmobile phone\nwhich is the the most touched device by\nby each one of us took 16 years correct\nthe chbd so it's just telling you how\nfast people are using it because they\nsee a value in it and they able to do\nthings faster so all of it will come\nback to the use of AI ethically\nresponsibly under the Right Guard drills\nand then things are fine I think my\ncolleague said a very nice thing adopt\nit adopt it ethically and see the\nbenefits okay so one very quick thing\nbefore we wrap up one word answers if\nthe AI Revolution and that wave is\ncoming our way to disrupt everyone's\nlife sitting in this room and you as AI\nexperts what is that one word that you\nreally think will make sure that this is\na safe and an inclusive Revolution one\nword from your end I would confidently\nsay embrace it embrace it samic embrace\nit with responsible AI Guardians embrace\nit to enhance and I'm I'm guessing you\nguys are much wiser in terms of AI as\nwell we'll all be taking questions even\nlater thank you so much for being a\nlovely audience and thank you for being\na Stella panel here at the India today\nCon thank you so\nmuch can I request you gentlemen to\nplease be on stage uh can I have Mr\nshantar chro of Hindustan power to\nplease come up and hand over a token of\nappreciation to Mr vaka and Mr\n[Music]\nSu please put your hands together ladies\nand gentlemen for Mr vak goalen and\nsamic Roy for joining us here at the\nIndia conclave for their extremely\ninsightful\n[Music]\ndiscussion thank you very much\n[Music]\n[Music]\nmuch\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nour next session is false alarm why the\nWest gets India's democracy wrong this\npromises to to be an extremely\ninteresting session I'd like to call\nupon the stage the moderator gorov\nSavant managing editor strategic Affairs\nand defense India Today TV on stage to\nintroduce our speakers for the next\n[Music]\nsession ladies and gentlemen good\nafternoon there is a report of varieties\nof democracy\nthis report has come out recently and\nthis report argues that there is a\nbackslide in India's democracy it argues\nthis is the 2024 report this comes at a\ntime when India is actually preparing\nfor the 2024 elections things are just\ngetting more exciting when it comes to\nthis\nelection India's critics are arguing at\nthis point of time that there is one\ndeterioration when it comes to freedom\nof expression there's a Crackdown on\nmedia there's a Crackdown on social\nmedia the argument is that Civil Society\nin India is under attack and that\nstringent sections of law are being\napplied to silen critics of the\ngovernment is West getting India's\ndemocracy wrong that's the question that\nI put to a guest this afternoon tripur\nDaman Singh is a scholar historian and\nauthor and may I request you to kindly\njoin us on stage\nsir\nbefore he and I talk may I also invite\non\nstage Asha modani J G you're a scholar\nat the Stanford you're a philanthropist\num I want you to share your thoughts may\nI request you to join us on stage and\nshare your thoughts is there a decline\nin India's\ndemocracy\n[Music]\nG thank you for having me here I want to\nbring to your attention something here's\nmy answer to what you just asked is is\nthe Indian democracy in a state of uh\ndilution decline\nweakness right U I'm going to I'm going\nto cite the example of a very dear\nfriend of mine called Professor Walter\nRussell me who is a scholar at the\nHudson Institute in Washington DC Walter\nis an established known Authority on\nDemocracy political science\ngeopolitics and uh he's also um a person\nwho works very closely in foreign policy\nhe an adviser to White House and um the\nuh here is what I heard from from Walter\nWalter said that couple of years ago he\ndidn't know much about India but then he\nwas told that you know this is what's\ngoing on you know you was Indian\ndemocracy he tried doing some research\nand he discovered that there are lots\nand lots of voices out there on the\ninternet and in media which are either\nextremely anti-india they're extremely\nPro India and he said you know what I'm\ngoing to do since I don't know India\nwell and this I'm talking about the West\nlet's let's assume Walter is a\nreflection of the West he said I'm going\nto pack my bags and visit India he comes\nhe comes and spends a little bit of time\nin India and he discovers\nthat whatever he had read in the media\nwas not only overblown from both sides\nbut what he didn't realize is that what\nhe uh you know what he discovered is\nthat uh the Democracy not just vibrant\nbut there is a there's something going\non here which is uh which is uh you know\nreflected in his meeting with Prime\nMinister Modi so Walter goes U gorov to\nmeet the PM and says how do you think I\nshould what should I do to gauge the\nhealth of Indian democracy and the Prime\nMinister\nsaid go to aoda and go to Varanasi which\nWalter did what's very interesting is\nafter plunging into both these cities he\ncame out with one brilliant Insight that\nwhat Modi has pulled off is marrying\nthis fer that's rising in India the sort\nof Hindu nationalism that might be there\nwith\nbusiness he has figured out a way to\ncreate profit out of it he said the kind\nof profits that Varanasi and aodha alone\nare generating is something that is if\nthat is replicated in the rest of India\nwe are looking at absolutely an act of a\ngenius being pulled off here it's\nbeginning it's very imperfect but it's\nhappening so he's so my view of that is\nthe West must spend the time to come and\nsee India and understand it better\nrather than judging it from from media\nhere so with that said Not only am I\nthrilled to have gorov but this but\ntripur is my nephew so enjoy thank you\nvery much ma'am very kind of you to have\njoined us um and set the stage for this\nconversation so um as a scholar as a\nhistorian as a writer as an academic do\nyou think there is a backslide you know\nwhen we talk about Indian democracy\nwe're all gearing up for the 2024\nelections now\nno I wrote a piece for the Journal of\ndemocracy last year as well on why the\nidea of backsliding is a misnomer in the\nIndian context first because it\nmisunderstands\nthe uh historical context in which\nIndian democracy was born it\nmisrepresents the Constitutional and\ninstitutional structure on which Indian\ndemocracy is premised uh and It suffers\nfrom what I call the Towell effect or a\nkind of recency bias so if you think\nabout backsliding\nbacksliding Visa what and backsliding\nfrom which point to which point\nso it's either backsliding from a\nnormative ideal which is generally taken\nto be the advanced democracies of\nWestern Europe and North\nAmerica India has never been like the\nadvanced democracies of Western Europe\nand North\nAmerica its foundation addressed a very\nspeciic specific set of circumstances it\nfaced a very specific set of questions\nso Indian democracy is normatively\nunique it's a it's a\nsingularity so comparison with the a\nnormative comparison with the advanced\ndemocracies of the west where you say\neach degree of\nDivergence uh or each um spectrum of\ndifference somehow represents a spectrum\nof inferiority is in my mind like a very\nuh strange and unproductive comparison\nto make what was the response to this\npiece of yours in the academic world in\nthe west um or from the society was\nthere a push\nback uh I mean academic debate is of\ncourse part and parcel of the job but I\ndo know that some people were were not\nvery happy with uh with what I'd written\num and many people I think suspect that\nit's in a that it that it could be seen\nas an attempt to provide a form of\nintellect ual cover to uh to the current\npolitical configuration uh of course\nthat is not my intention but uh\ninterestingly even when one of my books\nwent for peer review this was one of the\nuh pieces of feedback that came from the\nreviewers that I incorporate a paragraph\nuh in it saying that it is not my int it\nis not the intention of the book to\nprovide any sort of uh intellectual\ncover for any future sort of\nconstitutional scaldy uh which I did um\nin the the in the addition that was\npublished in Britain so um and this was\nonly for Britain so you were asked to\nadd a para to your book that it's not\nmeant to help a a\ngovernment\nuh I wasn't specifically asked to but\nthe way academic publishing works you\nget a series of reports from your\nacademic reviewers and you address the\nconcerns they raise um and so this was\none of the concerns and since uh I had\nto address that concern this was the\nprimary way that they expected me to\naddress it which which I did and\nobviously the book is not intended to\nprovide intellectual cover for any form\nof in constitutional scary\neither I you know before we come to your\nbook um and and talk about specifically\nabout the 16 days I want you to look at\nand I want friends here to look at some\nof the cartoons that have appeared in\nnewspapers uh in the media in in the\nWest for example when it came to Mission\nmongal India's Mission mongal and there\nwere U some cartoons that were printed\nin the Press there and not just that\nwhen Indian economy was doing very well\num you know they they show a snake\ncharmer uh and uh when when we talk\nabout India's population they show an\novercrowded train compared to China does\nall of that reflect a certain so for\nexample this is what appeared in a in a\nnewspaper or that uh India's Mangal\nMission Mars mission uh this is is this\nis this reflective of a bias against\nIndia it's definitely reflective of\nignorance and there's a sense of you\nknow orientalist stereotyping that\nsuffuses a lot of commentary and a lot\nof writing uh on India and there you\nknow there's there's no denying that uh\nsaying that that it isn't necessarily\nbias bias comes uh you know would come\nfrom a place of knowledge and a place of\ninformation this is uh down outright\nignorance and um it's quite common and I\nwould just flip that again so part of\nthe question is why the West\nmisunderstands what's happening in India\nand the underside of that question is\nwhy does India fail to represent and put\nforward its Point uh in you know in a\nway that can change the change the\ncurrent thinking so both sides of the\nquestion are worth worth thinking about\nokay because one of these cartoons and\nuh all of us who are sitting here we\ntalk about the international solar\nAlliance and India gaining from solar\nenergy and then uh a publication puts\nout poor people eating a solar\npanel this this cannot really be\nignorance this is this a bias is this a\npronounced\nbias yes and it's drawn very much from\nfrom ignorance from an old sty a kind of\nold style entitlement you know which uh\na lot of\norientalists uh commentary is was was\nsuffused by the idea that India was a\nnation of snake Charmers I mean uh if\nyou look at the visual imagery of\nMerchant Ivory films uh you know it's\nit's very much from that era and the\nWest uh or large parts of the Western\ncommentariat in a sense are yet to catch\nup with the transformation that India\nthat India has undergone and this is\nvery very representative of that it's an\nextremely poor taste and it is very\nrepresentative of a certain kind of\nignorance and a certain kind of\norientalist stereotyping which diffuses\nvery large parts of the West I'm not\nsaying that it's uh it doesn't represent\nbias I'm saying that that bias doesn't\nnecessarily come from a place of\nhostility but it definitely comes from a\nplace of profound\nignorance and when critics say that U\nlook at the Judiciary in India for\nexample U they don't really take on the\ngovernment um and and they they almost\nend up being on the same page as the\nexecutive do you buy that historically\nthe Judiciary in India has been shy of\ntaking on the government and of uh uh\nyou know having in a sense a real fist\nfight with the executive I think part of\nthe reason is that the Judiciary has\nbeen reticent to give judgments that\nthey do not think will meet a certain\nthreshold of social\nlegitimacy and they're wary of giving\njudgments which they do not think will\nbe obeyed or do they think will be\nopenly flouted if you look at it\nhistorically I mean the Judiciary has\ngiven has you know it legitimized the\nemergency it ruled that actually even\nthe right basic right to life and\nLiberty stood suspended and they gave a\njudgment supporting that um and so there\nis a by and part of it is of course the\nJudiciary is thinking part of it is also\nby Design India is very much uh as I\nsaid we were answering a very unique set\nof circumstances so India is by design\nan executive heavy democracy and it is\nthat for a variety of historical reasons\nand so the executive is very much placed\nin the driving seat uh of the\nConstitutional schemata so it is not\nsurprising that the Judiciary has shied\naway from uh challenging challenging the\nexecutive Beyond a point uh what is\nsurprising is actually the extent to\nwhich the Judiciary has gone it has\nactually through judge creation of uh\ndoctrines like the basic structure um\nactually acquired a degree of power\nwhich would be almost unheard of in many\nother Democratic setups okay when the\ngovernment talks about a uniform civil\ncode or or reforming personal laws does\nthat smack of\nmajoritarianism or is is the government\nwell within its rights to do so and the\nISM that comes India's way that this is\nnothing but again vote Bank politics or\nor rank\nmajoritarianism again two things India\nis majoritarian by Design the reason we\nchose the first pass the post system\nwhich generates you where you know a\nrelatively small percentage of votes can\ngenerate very very large major\nmajorities was designed precisely for\nthis reason because they saw it as\nguaranteeing a kind of stability and a\nkind of Unified Government at the center\nwhich would otherwise not acre if you\nhad taken on say a presidential\nadversarial sort of presidential system\nlike the US uh or proportional\nrepresentation as you see in many\ncountries in Europe so we are\nmajoritarian by\nDesign\nagain we have what is often called and\nif you look back at perhaps the the big\ndog of constitutional Scholars Granville\nAustin um we have a constitution that is\nsocial revolutionary in nature it hands\nto the state vast powers to intervene in\nthe social do domain to regulate social\nrelationships to legalize social\nrelationships and that was precisely\nbecause India's founding figures\nambedkar and Neu chiefly thought that\nIndian Society lacked the capacity for\nsocial reform in and of itself and that\nis why not only did the state arm itself\nwith these vast coercive Powers it\nintervened very heavily in the social\ndomain to reform Hindu laws to regulate\nfor example to open up\ntemples uh to have state intervention in\ntemples which is now a very contentious\nquestion as you know uh um for on the\nquestion of cast uh and to address the\nquestion of cast discrimination and so\nif you have that logic driving the\nConstitutional schemata to say that\nsomehow one section of the population\ncan be immune to it or somehow has the\ncapacity for social reform but\nx uh you know segment of the population\ndoesn't to my mind smacks of uh a kind\nof very it's it's facts of cognitive\ndissonance if one was to make that claim\nso if you're reforming let's say the\nHindu laws you well within your rights\nto reform Muslim laws and that does not\nrank of majoritarianism or reak of\nmajoritarianism it doesn't reak of\nmajoritarianism at all uh in fact\ncompletely the opposite in fact more or\nless uh again I will give you uh a\nhistorical example by force of habit\nnothing else um it is that generally\nwhen say really consequential steps have\nbeen taken they've been justified by\nreference to the directive principles of\nState policy with the idea that these\nwere in effect guidelines based on which\nthe governance of the country was to be\nconducted and so there was an idea and\nit was very much put into the\nconstitution in the form of a directive\nprinciple that one day we would have\nUniversal civil law\nuh and so first it is not majoritarian\nsimply because we chose a particular\nsystem we chose it for a reason uh and\nsecondly given that the state is armed\nwith a certain degree of power to\nintervene in the social domain for a\nparticular reason for it to use that\npower for precisely that reason uh\ncannot really be termed majoritarianism\nin my opinion at all again that\ncriticism that comes um India's way is\non the use of laws on sedition yeah\nyou've written extensively on the First\nAmendment and the manner in which first\namendment was brought in uh when you\nhear this criticism when you read about\nthis criticism that the government uses\nstringent sections of the law to silence\ncritics where do you stand on\nthat there's no denying that the\nSedition law is uh and now it's been\nreplaced by another law uh which is more\nor less the same uh that the Sedition\nlaw is open to misuse but it was always\nopen to misuse\nuh in fact it was Again by design it was\ndesigned for misuse it was designed to\nsuppress uh Indian nationalists during\nthe during the Raj era and so for that\nreason they the more it was my apologies\nit was more or less decided that it\nwould be done away with when the\nConstitution uh was written up and as\nyou mentioned it was brought back via\nthe First Amendment and the biggest\nreason why it was opposed uh by such a\nwide constellation and just just to give\nyou a tiny nugget of information among\nthe people that uh sedition was\ncontemplated against it was Neu even\ncontemplated using it against uh sham\nPrasad mukarji who was then his own\ncabinet colleague so it's a it's a law\nwritten in necessarily broad terms to\nserve uh to serve an executive heavy\nagenda so it's not surprising that it's\nmisused it is surprising to me that\nactually those who are subjected to it\nwhen they come into power decide that\nit's well it's now well and good and\nthis is another Trend in Indian politics\nand you will see it throughout history\nis that nobody\nactually comes up with a concrete\nproposal to do away with those elements\nthat promote a certain kind of\nauthoritarianism or a certain kind of\nconcentration in amplification of\nexecutive power because everyone wants\nto use it for their own particular\nagenda so everyone opposes sedition when\nthey're in the opposition and everyone\nis happy to use it once you know you're\nsitting on the chair of government\nthere's also a lot of criticism uh off\nlate that free speech is under\ntremendous threat in India and that\nsystems of checks and balances are\nfailing you know what whether it's it's\nthe Press it's the social media that's\nunder attack stringent sections of law\nbeing used to to silence critics in your\nappreciation has anything special been\ndone in in the past 10 years or is that\nwhat the system has been like um you\nknow in in our country so as I again I\nspeak about the Towell effect Again part\nof the reason why there is a lot of um\nin a sense bruhaha over over Free Speech\nnow is because you can see a lot more\nthan you could see 20 years ago 30 years\nago 40 years ago 50 years ago but in the\narena for free speech in India has\nalways been at the capriciousness of the\nexecutive so India will never be as\nliberal as it was on 26 January 1950 the\nday the Constitution was\nenforced every Constitutional Amendment\nevery legal tool that the government has\ncreated after that has only constrained\nthat Arena legally and constitutionally\nuh over the last 50 70 a\nyears now you have a situation where\nsomeone the state has the power to act\nthe way it does to constrain Free Speech\nthe way it does to squeeze that Arena\nwhenever it wants and then it's left to\nthe capriciousness of you know whoever\nsitting in power the moods whims and\nfancies of whoever sitting in power to\ndo as they will and so legally and\nconstitutionally that Arena has always\nbeen extremely constrained it depends on\nhow far the government wants to\nintervene in that domain and then to\nfault uh a particular government for\nusing the powers that it has been\ngranted for the for exactly the purposes\nthat it is using them to my mind is\nagainst brownie Point scoring without\nactually having any sense about how to\naddress that problem if that is\ngenuinely a problem someone should come\nup with a concrete proposal to say this\nis what we're going to do and we're\ngoing to undo x y and Zed bits of\nIndia's constitutional scheme or India's\nlegal structure to prevent that domain\nfrom being constrained in the future but\nno one does it\nuh and I think that is the that is more\nimportant than any commentary on the\nfact that Free Speech might be facing a\nroll back or not in my eyes it's a it's\nbasically an oscillation dependent\nsolely and completely on the whims and\nfancies of whoever sits in the chair of\npower interesting and as we GE up for\nthe 2024 elections this dance of\ndemocracy continues I'm sure all of you\nare going out to vote but um are we as\nsome argue an elected a talk y or a\nvibrant

our\nsession moderator Rahul C news director\nTVN and managing editor special online\nprojects executive director business\n[Music]\ntoday\n[Music]\nwe've spent a lot of time at the India\nToday conclave talking\nabout how India is evolving politically\nand\neconomically economic strength also\nchanges the world order and India's\nposition unquestionably on the global\nhigh table has changed in the last 10\nyears but what can potentially happen\nover the next five given the global\nuncertainty and all the other factors at\nplay how is India's position at the\nglobal high table likely to change what\nare the Tailwinds propelling us what are\nthe headwinds pushing us back to talk\nabout that we're joined at the India\nToday conclave by three super sharp\nvoices on geoeconomics and geopolitics\nallow me to introduce first one of India\npreeminent public intellectuals Dr Samir\nSaran president of the Observer Research\nFoundation we've got B brande president\nof the world economic Forum thank you\nvery much rud Chri heads carnagi India\nthank you very much for joining us and\nit's an absolute pleasure to have you\nwith us so far Dr sarin India's rise\nover the past 10 years has been largely\nbenign where we've been able to navigate\ncomplicated trapezes Russia Ukraine\nwhat's happening in the mid East\ncontinuing our ties with uh the United\nStates China remains a big stumbling\nblock but apart from that the government\nhas navigated the Foreign Affairs space\nsmartly how do you see that change over\nthe next 5 years are we likely to see\nmore head winds uh trying to push us\nback or will the tail winds given the\ncurrent geopolitical order continue to\npush us forward let's start from there\nso Rahul I think the last 10 years have\nnot been benign we have navigated a\nreally complex decade we have come out\nlargely unscathed by all that has\ntranspired and it's it's really been a\nrocky road and all credit to the Indian\nestablishment Indian industry and Indian\npeople for being able to pull together\nand pull out of uh some of the most um\nuh troubling periods including the\npandemic the conflicts both in our\nneighborhood Afghanistan people have\nforgotten about it Ukraine uh more\nrecently the Middle East but even prior\nto that the shock that were literally\nbuffeting us since the early 2010s so\nit's been a troubling decade and it's\nnot going to change what's going to be\nadded to this challenge uh is going to\nbe how people view India's rise in the\ndays ahead uh till now people have\ncelebrated an additional place for\nInvestments uh additional engine for\ngrowth I think Bor mentioned this\nmorning 15% of global growth comes from\nIndia so there is a bit of a celebration\nabout having an alternative about having\nsomething uh extra uh driving Global\ngrowth but at some point the second word\nis going to come into place and that's\nConformity Everyone likes additionality\nIndia offers additionality so they\ncelebrate that but they also want\nConformity do we conform to what they\nassess is uh um a free Society a free\nmarket a democracy a political system\nand there you are going to see uh\nincreasingly India's growth attract\ngreater attention greater criticism\ngreater scrutiny greater push back in\nwhat way sorry in what way oh um you\nknow you had an ambassador of a country\ntalking about CA uh you know from a\ncountry which is having a problem of\nmigration and immigration of of this is\nEric garetti speaking at the Eric\ngaretti for example you know someone who\nis probably familiar with the society in\nHollywood is now becoming an expert on\nIndian uh political establishment so you\nknow for example you're going to see\nunnecessary comments of this kind right\nbecause it makes news it gives you\nvisibility it attracts people uh uh to\nyour to your job and to your\nresponsibility so you're going to see\nyou know I I think the foreign minister\nsaid it or someone said it on his panel\nyou're going to see political sledging\nan equivalent of what you see in cricket\nyou're going to see sledging happen\nyou're going to see India being you know\nthese pin Pricks these small um clumsy\nstatements emanating from uh you know\nunconcerned and un uh uninformed sources\nand you'll have to handle that that's\none part but the second and more inous\nand difficult part is many of these\nGlobal institutions that are going to be\npretty much respons ible for and I think\nsanjie mentioned it in one of his\ndiscussions sanjie s mentioned it in one\nof his discussions many of those who are\ngoing to be responsible for rating your\ncredit worthiness or for looking at your\nESG scores and multiple other indices\nthey are going to be influenced by many\nof these voices as well so you will have\nto institutionally prepare for yourself\nto make a case for India that allows the\nlargest pool of global Capital to flow\ninto your geography it's not going to be\neasy Japan is a Case Case in point south\nKoreans have gone through this period as\nwell uh I mean Americans have gone\nthrough this period the English didn't\ngive them the keys to the kingdom\nwithout resistance so history will tell\nyou that emergence is not necessarily an\neasy Journey you will have to battle it\nout so we have a good decade ahead of\ngrowth of prosperity of of lifting\npeople out of poverty and and meeting\naspirations of one and a half billion\npeople but we will have to do it with\nmuscles so we'll have to build our own\nmuscles I want to draw B BR into this uh\ndebate because when we spoke last you\nsaid that that this uh coming time will\nbe the time of the G3 China the United\nStates and India shaping the global\norder and that things are likely to get\nbetter for India in the time to come\nbecause the world is looking Beyond\nChina because of what else is happening\ninternationally samir's argument is that\nthere will be a push back a push back\nwhich creates friction or tensions the\nworld will not very easily accept\nIndia's rise because no country's rise\nhas been accepted easily ever going back\nin time do you buy that that this G3 may\nnot fall into place as easily as people\nsitting in this audience would like and\nthat they very serious headwinds India\nwould have to deal with I I didn't say\nthat but you paraphrase me in a nice way\ngo\nahead so um I think there is clear\ncorrelation between a country's economic\nsuccess and also\ninfluence uh uh just in its neighborhood\nbut also globally I think this is\nfrequently\noverlooked Soviet Union was forever\nuntil it was no more and the reason why\nthe Soviet Union was struggling at least\nthe last two decades was that economic\ngrowth was not happening anymore still\nin the 60s and the 70s there were some\ngrowth so uh the reason why India's uh\nalso political position in my view will\nbe strengthened and we'll have more\nleverage in the years to come is uh to\nthe due fact that uh India's economy is\nalso growing uh very very fast so it's\ngoing to go from a three trillion uh US\nDollars economy to a 10 trillion one um\nat least uh in the coming uh decade that\nwill also uh give India uh opportunity\nto invest more in education research but\nalso its Army and defense you will see\nalso a stronger India there and then to\nyour question will this uh raise\nconcerns will this also uh create\nchallenges I think maybe mainly in its\nneighborhood because the fact is that in\nmany uh of these countries in India's\nneighborhood already China and India\nmeet each other in Myanmar Bangladesh\nNepal Bhutan Sri Lanka um so uh this is\nalready a fact I think India is\ncurrently uh in a honeymoon phase uh\nglobally uh in many ways especially in\nEurope and uh in the US but honeymoons\ndon't last long so for some marriages it\ncan uh even improve and improve and uh\nbut of course the honeymoons are are\nvery nice period but uh you know low can\ngrow even stronger per every year how\nnice rudra this tension that we're\nseeing particularly with Canada uh to\nsome extent with the United States\nexpressed largely in private sometimes\nin public somei referred to the comments\nmade by Ambassador garetti on the\ncitizenship Amendment act will the print\nPricks in fre or will countries like the\nUnited States a country that you studied\nand analyzed closely continue seeing the\nlarger picture and even if there is some\nopposition or resentment it's voiced\nmore privately and not made a but big\ndeal of publicly no thanks R just you\nknow one point I'll make if the\npresident of the world economic Forum\nturns around and says is that India\nlooks like a honeymoon despite all the\nchallenges that Samir has talked about\nand all the contradictions that frankly\nthis leadership has had to deal with in\nthe last decade I think that's a pretty\ngood outcome right um because challenges\nare there it's definitely not a\nhoneymoon for India challenges are there\nwith Europe as you grow economically\npolitically strategically those\nchallenges will be there even with\nlike-minded States um on the point that\nyou're making look I think let me just\nget away from the pin Pricks to some of\nthe Strategic stuff where are we in\nIndia today what are we dealing with\nright one we have a geopolitical\nchallenge which is a war in Ukraine\nwhich has pushed us frankly to think\nvery seriously about divers ification of\nour strategic resources reconsider our\nrelations with Russia turn to countries\nthat have the capability to deliver for\nus and our interests over the next many\ndecades countries like the United States\non the one hand countries like France on\nthe other my own senses you know down\nthe line is and you know the elections I\nthink have been called today whichever\nway you know in the sense I mean it's\npretty clear Which Way India is going to\ngo in the near future it's not very\nclear where other countries are going\ngoing to go in the near future I think\nactually there's more opportunity I\nthink we and the reason I see the\nopportunity is because we've created\nthat space in The Last 5 Years which\nhave been very difficult not everybody's\nmanage that space right so today for\ninstance we have a relationship with the\nUnited States that covers everything\nfrom Quantum to AI to defense\nTechnologies there are a lot of people\nfrom the private sector here they\ninvested in this relationship I think in\na way in which they weren't even 2 or 3\nyears ago that's going to continue will\nyou have instability if a new government\ncomes in the US sure but I think by and\nlarge we will have\nI mean the line is pretty clear in that\nsense um at least with the United\nStates the most complicated relationship\nfor India is China Samir and when it\ncomes to Bing over the next 5 years how\ndo you see the relationship play out\nwe're currently in\na in a state of uh you know\nconfrontation along the border our\neconomic ties uncom completely Frozen\nbut clearly are far from the good times\nof the past does this continue at some\npoint in time do you think Bing sees\ngood uh reason and then starts piping\ndown or do you think this is the way\nit's likely to stay you know rul when I\nsorry let me just take a minute to\nexplain my first opening statement you\nknow I I was talking about sledging I\nwas not talking about substance\nsubstantively we should in some ways\ndevelop a thick skin and muscles to\nignore some of these Bobs that will come\nour way the this is virtue signaling\nthis is American politics playing out\nits own self uh and and expressing them\nin in in in a manner that implicates us\nbut this is largely American political\nsystem using India as a tool to settle\ntheir own unsettled agendas at home uh\nand uh we should rather focus on what is\nreally happening with the US and and the\nStrategic Community the foreign policy\nCommunity the business Community is\nbetter on India uh similarly that's true\nfor what BGE was saying about the\nEuropeans as well and I think that's the\nreal story the real story is that India\nis moving from 4 trillion to 10 trillion\nand then 15 trillion over the next\ndecade decade and a half and people want\nto be part of that Journey people want\nto benefit from it how can we open more\ndoors how can we make regulatory\npredictability uh uh uh offering that we\nuh put on the table how can we uh remove\nsupply chain irritants and and make\nIndia the manufacturing Hub so for us\nthe uh the real uh task in the next 5\nyears in the next 10 years is to\ncontinue to receive the interest that\nthat we have generated curtsy the\nprevious 10 years we have to get used to\nsledging now we are playing we are\nplaying men's Cricket or or or women's\ncricket and we are playing it in uh in a\nformat which is competitive and we're\ngoing to have to deal with folks who\nwill think otherwise and we have to\nbuild the capacity to do that in many\nways uh the India China relationship is\na big driver in This Global interest in\nus the Chinese Behavior not only towards\nus but towards everyone has been the\nsingle biggest Catalyst to to to shine\nthe torch on India and the possibility\nIndia offers so more power to Xi Jinping\nmay he remain forever and May people\ncontinue to see India in in the light\nthat they are already doing so I think\nChina has done a Human Service in some\nways to us and his behavior has opened\ndoors and windows and perhaps even made\nus more aware of the the need to look at\nother Partnerships and and opportunities\nuh Beyond Beijing otherwise uh you know\nin the last decade in the early part of\nthe last decade uh you were seeing uh um\na huge amount of growth in in the\ntrading relationship between does the\nIndia China relationship get worse over\nthe next 5 years\nhere is my take I think it's going to\nget worse before it get before it gets\nbetter I think the next five years are\nreally turbulent uh at some stage maybe\nwhen we are close to 6 or 7 trillion and\nwe have $150 to $200 billion sorry when\nwe have 300 to $400 billion defense\nbudget and and security um uh\ncapabilities we will make it costly for\nthem to be adventurous uh at this time\nwe have the largest asymmetry between\nthe two and for them uh troubling us on\nthe border pushing us on certain\nFrontiers you know creating their large\npresence in the Indian Ocean is rather\nis rather easy uh we will have to make\nit costly for them and I think that\nbecomes that starts changing this decade\ntowards the later part of this decade\nand I think post that you will see a new\num perhaps uh Unwritten uh uh agreement\nbetween the two to not cross certain red\nlines we have to draw those red lines\nand we have to make it costly when they\nbreach those red lines so I think it's\ngoing to be a little turbulent it's\ngoing to be worse before it gets better\nand it's probably going to be half a\ndecade before wey what's your outlook on\nChina's prospects we seeing different\nkinds of prognosis in terms of the\neconomic V the different sectors that\nChinese economy are facing but it still\nis a massive economic reality globally\nuh and what's your sense of where China\nmoves from here and how that impacts\nIndia's\nrise so it's um always challenging to to\ndiscuss uh China uh in New Delhi but\num tell us what you would even if you\nwere we have to be real political about\nthat so if you look at uh China um in\n1980 China was\n0.5% of the global economy today China\nis around 17\nto 20% of the world economy and uh it's\ndefinitely competing with the us and we\nare seeing now a competition between\nthese two large economies that we never\nseen before the US\n20% uh sorry\n25% of the global economy with 5% of the\nglobal\npopulation uh so us is is is\neconomically uh still an exceptional\nPowerhouse the interesting thing uh and\nI think when we're in India is to see\nhow has India uh maneuvered or how has\nIndia uh come out of this competition\nthat I think we will just see more of in\nthe years to come between the US and\nChina and as long as it's competition\nand not\ndecoupling um I think we still will see\nglobal economic growth is that and that\nis coming back to uh my last Point uh in\nmy first intervention is that\nIndia has uh in many ways benefited from\nthis cor uh um this competition because\nuh many countries are now looking at\ntheir supply chains uh their n Shoring\ntheir friend Shoring and we are seeing\nmore manufacturing coming uh to India\nand many countries R including the US\nlook at China and uh India where they\nlook at India as um kind of check and\nbalances in Asia so checks and balances\nuh is something that uh Other Nation\nNations do look up as a positive factor\nbecause you don't want to have the\nwinner takes it all you want to have\nchecks and balances when India gets um\nstronger and also economically and open\nup its markets because if it wants to be\na manufacturing Hub you also have to\nimport the input factors you can't\nproduce everything in your own country\nuh in that uh respect because then you\nwill not really be the manufacturing Hub\nuh of the world that opens up also new\nopportunities for other countries for\nforeign direct Investments uh India will\nalso know need to maneuver very\ndelicately\nuh in its uh security and foreign policy\ncurrently a lot of the military\nequipment in India comes from Russia and\nwith the unlimited friendship uh between\nChina and Russia I guess that uh the\ncurrent leadership uh in India also\nmakes its own uh Reflections based on\nthis so there is a lot of interesting\nthings um to see forward what we hope\nfor is that that even in a polarized\nfractured World we'll find areas where\nwe can collaborate because many of the\nmost serious problems do not uh travel\nwith a passport they are transboundary\nand in these areas climate change\nhandling AI future\npandemics both the G3 India China and\nthe US has to collaborate and uh they\ncan compete in other areas but in these\nareas I do hope uh there's possibility\nto find common interesting points there\nrud Chri uh Samir makes the argument\nthat relations with China get worse\nbefore they ultimately get better based\non India's rise economically militarily\nuh B made the point that India is\nactually benefiting because of the way\nthat China has been acting do things get\nbetter do they get worse do they stay\nthe same no just to respond to what B\nsaid look I think in terms of you look\nat what is the opportunity and challenge\nfor India in the near future\nthe opportunity is the changing nature\nof geopolitics that's very clear what\ndoes that essentially mean it means the\ndislocation of economic production from\none major country to others and there is\na lot of support from around the world\nfor that dislocation in itself can India\nabsorb a lot of that dislocation\nabsolutely is that an opportunity for us\nat the operational level at the business\nlevel yes are we seeing it happen yes\nfrankly what's the big challenge I would\nsay the challenge for us in terms of\ngeopolitics is in fact what the honor\nprime minister and a range of other\nministers have mentioned is a rate at\nwhich we can actually keep absorbing\nthis which means factor market change\nwhich means ease of doing business we're\nseeing a lot of it happen we need to see\nit happen faster to be able to make sure\nthat we're actually arresting these\ngeopolitical opportunities we see it in\nsemiconductors we're seeing it in\nelectronic manufacturing you know rul 2\nyears ago um we were told by a lot of\npeople that there's no way that India\nwill have a 28 Nano Foundry you'll never\nget it today you have a company from\nTaiwan investing with a company in India\n28 Nano how did that happen some of it\nwas dislocation some of it was change\nthat was made Made in India that made\nthis happened in itself so we look at\nopportunities will it get worse with\nChina before it gets better on the\nboundary anybody's guess geopolitically\nI think as Samir mentioned it's not a\nbad place to be where we are in some\nsense let's spend a moment on India's\nmost important relationship which make\nno mistake is the United States where\nwe've seen bipartisan support to India's\ngrowth now some of it is marred by some\nof the comments that have been made or\nfor example what's been happening on the\nissue of khalistan and America's\nperception around that uh but there's\nalso a bright chance that Donald Trump\nmay come to power once again in the US\nin both those circumstances if the\nDemocrats were to come back to Power\nwill the with will the stress increase\nand what happens Samir in your view\nbetween the Indian government whoever it\nis that comes to power and a Donald\nTrump Trump Administration look I think\non that count we should be actually uh\nquite confident that irrespective of who\nwins the elections in November India is\ngoing to be doing fairly well and uh I\nthink the drivers for that are pretty\nmuch what we have already discussed in\nthis panel that there is a new\ngeoeconomic framework that is emerging\nand India is going to be one of the hubs\nis one of the central pillars of that\nnew geoeconomic framework we know the\npolitical frictions and competition and\ncontest that are underway between the\nbig two currently is going to give us a\nprivileged position uh we know that the\nregion we are in is going to contribute\nyou know I think there's a IMF report\nthat says 60% of global growth is or 80%\nof global growth is from the emerging\nand developing countries many of those\nwho are in this neighborhood so even the\ngrowth and economic drivers are uh\nrelated to us pretty intimately so I\nthink Americans who have understood real\npolitic and perhaps have written\nchapters on it in in the last century\nunderstand this better than most and\nwhoever sits in DC is obviously going to\nhave a um a public facing uh domestic uh\nconversation and narrative that is going\nto appease their constituencies but that\naside in real substantive terms what the\nus and India achieved in the last 20\nyears was Unthinkable if someone was\nsitting in 2000 uh you know India Today\n2000 would we be talking about us being\nIndia's most important partner it would\nbe really a ludicrous conversation to be\nhaving but it's true it's happened the\nthe most transformational relationship\nof this Century has been the India us\nrelationship and that direction is not\ngoing to change Donald Trump may add\ntariffs and may seek to bring\nmanufacturing back to America they\nDonald Trump may see think Biden's\ninflation deduction Act is the\nendorsement of his own earlier um\ndetermination uh to protect American\nindustry all of that aside in real terms\nthe India us relationship is bound to\ngrow both in terms of its economic\nengagement it's its political alignment\nand more and more importantly it's\nincreasingly intimate security\nArrangements do not forget what the US\nhas done in the Border confrontation\nwith China over the last 3 years it is\nthe most underwritten and discussed part\nbut please understand today you have\nmore teeth and more muscles on the\nborders curtsy some of the access to\nTechnologies eyes in the sky and and\ncollaboration between the two\nestablishments the intimacy in defense\nrelationship is going to be what is\ngoing to be perhaps really\ntransformational in the next 5 years if\nDonald Trump comes back or even if Biden\nremains I think it is a material who's\nsitting in the White House that white\nhouse and and and India are going to\ncontinue to have the special relu so\nthere are two theories one is that\nbehind the scenes America is indeed\nputting a lot of pressure uh and they're\nasking India to be a certain way which\nconforms to as Samir says you know what\nis acceptable in the local American\ncontext the other is that there's way\ntoo much practicality and pragmatism and\nthey're going to hold their nose if they\ndon't like something but just they\nrealize the inevitable inevitability of\nwanting to continue to partner in\nIndia's rise which one of the two do you\nthink is more likely to play out in the\nnext 5 years the tension is going to\nexist um you know on this particular\nincident that you talked about I think\nin the summer there'll be newspaper\nheadlines there will be a some case that\ntakes place in New York Etc there will\nbe some kind of push and pressure in\nitself my own sense is pretty clear\nstrategically we're absolutely clear in\nterms of where we're going with the US I\nthink the US Administration whichever\none it is is pretty clear where it's\ngoing with India the operational tension\nwill be left to diplomacy and how you\ndeal with that but the Strategic\nInvestments that are we seeing at the\nmoment is I think will help balance the\nscales at least in the near future there\nare just way too many American\nInvestments coming this way you have a\nUS Army today coming to India and saying\nthat listen we have to decouple all our\nmilitary supply chains by 2028 we need\nto do it here we need your ammunition\nfactories when you have that game of\nLeverage where your producing what they\nneed not only for themselves but also\nfor the world it changes the tone of the\ndebate altogether look the the look at\nthe Ukraine conflict right Russia is out\nproducing the entire EU and American\nproduction complex defense defense\nindustrial complex uh I was in a\nconversation with uh some quad members\nand names shall not be taken and one of\nthe biggest anxieties and perhaps even\ntheir optimistic assessments was that\nbring India into Play Bring\nmanufacturing at scale into play if they\nneed to be producing at scale to\nconfront and and you know Russia is not\nChina China is multiple multiple times\nuh the threat the Russian\ncapabilities you know POs to them so\nthey are really thinking about this\nbeing being the big base that allows uh\nthe largely uh similar like-minded\ncountries that constitute the court to\nbe able to put together a framework but\nbut just one more thing but you know\neven look at the even look at the\nsledging as I call it right look at it\nlook at what the American response was\nto something that happened in the\nCanadian response was American response\nremove the American Media American Media\nhas its own life lives in la la land and\nlet them cater to the readers there but\nlook at the American state the American\nstate had conversation behind closed\ndoors and you had the Canadians going to\ntheir Parliament and making crazy\nstatements and that's the difference\nbetween a country that is determined to\ncreate a strategic relationship with a\npartner and sees in the partner a future\nthat is cjoint and and and in many ways\ncoterminous while the other one is\nbasically seeking votes for the next\nelections that's the difference between\nthe American Elite when you look at\nIndia's rise what worries you the most\nwhat is it that you think uh is a of\ngreatest concern from your\nPurge so maybe I'll comment on this um\nsituation about uh us India relations\nfirst and then I I'll come back uh to\nthat you know there is between the US\nand uh India there is uh not a lot of\nchallenges it's it's\nmainly um common\ninterests uh and you know the only\nbipartisan issue in Washington DC is the\nrelationship uh with China and uh in\nIndia is not relying a lot on export and\nimport from China contrary to many other\nnations there is some but not as much as\nEurope that also uh of course is\nimporting a lot from China but also\nexports um to uh China so Europe uh is\nmore uh between a rock and a hard place\nin that relationship India also has um\nthe advantage for itself that the growth\nin the years to come will also come a\nlot from the emerging economies and as I\nsaid to you earlier today Rahul already\n50% in the coming years of the global\ngrowth will come from emerging economies\nand after 2040 probably\n60% so so India can also build an\necosystem of friends among these\nemerging economies in Latin America in\nAfrica but also in\nasan uh that can benefit uh India the\nstrength of the us since the second\nworld war is not only that they were on\ntop of the Britain Woods institutions\nbut they also had a unique ecosystem of\nfriends and um with the US India\nrelations we have seen that uh India has\nbeen able to work both with President\nTrump but uh also with the current\nAdministration the challenges for India\nmoving forward is that uh um on the\nsecurity side uh of course any kind of\nconflicts and Wars will uh be very\nnegative for growth and investment so\nthat's why I think there will be uh also\nsolution\non the border conflicts with uh with\nChina I don't think that is any uh of\nthese two nation's interest to escalate\nuh this further but of course uh India\nrelies a lot today as I mentioned on\nRussian military equipment and I think\nIndia also in the coming decade will be\na big buyer of U us equipment to um both\nhedge but also make sure that uh one can\nthen uh manage uh the necessary\ndeterrence another ex factor is the\ndevelopment in Pakistan and we know that\nPakistan is also a nuclear uh Power I\ndon't think there will be uh major\nflareups but of course uh we uh can see\na further\ndeteriation uh in this relationship\nhopefully not\nbut we know the economic situation in\nPakistan uh is not um not the best so\nthen I so India needs to maneuver its\nneighboring uh area and many of the\nneighbors are also uh Muslim countries\nand uh this is something also India of\ncourse has to factor in uh it in its um\nin its policy so the stopwatch tells me\ntime's up and therefore this is is where\nI wrap up B brand for coming all the way\nfrom the world economic Forum in\nSwitzerland thank you very much thanks\nalso to rudra and to Samir Saran for\njoining us we were able to cover a fair\namount of ground and give you some food\nfor thought on how India's equations\nwith important Global players are likely\nto change the good and maybe they not so\ngood so thank you very much can we have\na warm Round of Applause for our\nspeakers for this session thank you very\nmuch thank you thank you thank gentlemen\nI request you to stay on stage can I\nhave Mr abish K managing director of\nradical ketan to join us here on stage\nand hand over a token of our\n[Music]\nappreciation a big round of applause\nplease and a big thank you to Mr Chri Mr\nsinin and Mr BR for taking the time out\nand join us here at the India Today\n[Music]\nconclave Mr\n[Music]\nK\n[Music]\nso the election dates are out let's get\nback to hardcore politics shall we\nthat's exactly what our next session is\nIndia's opposition the search for a\nnarrative and strategy and I'd like to\ninvite session moderator prti Chri\nexecutive editor India Today television\nto introduce our speakers for the\n[Music]\nsession\nso ladies and gentlemen every time um as\na student you knew exams are around the\ncorner but the dates were not out so you\ncould chill a bit it'll take some time\nbut when it comes down to election we\nknew the elections are around the corner\nbut the dates are not out well the dates\nare out exactly an hour ago and in 33\ndays the first vote will be cast it will\nbe a battle of narratives where it comes\ndown to the India Alliance versus the\nthe NDA till now whether one likes it\nnot likes it the perceptional narrative\nis that the BJP will it cross 370 will\nthe NDA reach 400 will the Congress\nactually cross 50 not quite about who is\ngoing to win this election does the\nIndia Alliance have a strategy a\nnarrative I want to invite on stage\nformer Chief Minister Jammu and Kashmir\nOmar\nAbdullah former deputy chief minister\nRajasthan such as\npilot Delhi cabinet minister arief so\nthe arm admy party the NC and the\nCongress all part of the India Alliance\nthere seems to be a bit of an ambiguity\nwhere the NC is concerned is it still\npart of the India Alliance not part of\nthe India Alliance we're going to take\nthat question right on top Mr Abdullah\nare you a part of the India Alliance\nstill because your father says you're\ngoing to do it alone you say that you\ndon't want to go with the muftis or the\nPDP but you want to go with the Congress\nbut there's ambiguity there no there's\nabsolutely no ambiguity uh We've made it\nvery clear that uh we are a part of the\nIndia Alliance and uh our seat sharing\ntalks with the Congress have more or\nless concluded uh we' made it very clear\nthat the three seats that are already\nwith the India Alliance which are the\nseats uh from the Kashmir Valley those\nwill be contested by the National\nConference and the other three seats in\nurw Jammu and Kashmir including ladak\nand karil in that as well those will be\ncontested by the Congress in\nconsultation with particularly for the\nkaril ladak seat in consultation with\nother groups there but the PDP is now\nnot a part of the India Alliance no\nthat's a question for the Congress I'm\nnot answerable for the PDP and I'm not\nanswerable for the wider India Alliance\nI'm answerable for my relationship with\nthe India Alliance not the pdp's\nrelationship so you have no no\nrelationship with the PDP with the PDP\nlook you're talking about the India\nAlliance right now okay fine all right\nso that's for the Congress um but Mr\nAbdullah to ask you the election dates\nwere announced a that bit disappointed\nthat Jammu and Kashmir dates were not\nout today well I'm a bit disappointed\nbut not surprised uh because all this ha\nthat's been created about one nation one\nelection uh clearly uh the election\ncommission the jnk government and to\nthat extent the government of India uh\nis unable to put its money where its\nmouth is I mean this was an ideal time\nto actually roll out the process of one\nnation one election now if you can't\nhave one nation I mean you can't have\nJammu and Kashmir polls at the same time\nas the rest of the country now how are\nyou promising it for\n2029 this was a test case and clearly in\nthis test case they failed we were very\nhopeful look we haven't had an Assembly\nelection in Jammu and Kashmir since 2014\nso you're going on 10 years now 10 years\nis a long time to not have elections in\nJammu and Kashmir especially at a time\nwhen the government of India is busy\ntelling the whole world that everything\nis so much better if it is so much\nbetter then the proof of the pudding is\nin the eating let's have those elections\nand let's see how much better things are\nMr pilot 33 days before the first vote\nis cast the first phase of election 19th\nof April unfortunately for the India\nAlliance which your party is a huge part\nof the conversation is not who will be\nthe Prime Minister but who will be the\nleader of opposition whether you'll even\ncross that 54 Mark of the 10% where five\nwhy are you smiling Mr\nAbdullah okay it's actually isn't\nit unfortunately that's a statement that\nhas come from you I have never heard\nthat we don't think like that and P just\nso that you know we are fighting this\nelection to win whether we win or not\nthat is dependent on the people of this\ncountry and it's best that that judgment\nremains on hold till June 4th number one\nnumber two India Alliance as a\npartnership came to the front because of\ncircumstances that this country\nwitnessed for the last 9 years in the\nlast 9 years the governance the report\ncard of the government the data the\nissues that matter to the people should\nbe at the centerpiece of our\nconversation and and a narratives\nunfortunately what has happened in the\nlast 9 years has been a constant\nsystematic attack on the well\nestablished constitutional entities in\nthe country for last 70 years so various\ndifferent parties and I'm sure the next\nquestion will be TMC nii V party nii\nfair enough but the attempt was to get\nall opposition together so that we can\nhave a formidable and surmount of\nchallenge to the NDA and defeat them at\nthe pole\nHastings India Alliance except one or\ntwo parties about 24 party strong and\ndon't forget in\n2019 the BJP got 37% plus minus that\nmeans 2/3 of the voters who went to the\npolling Booth voted against the BJP that\nmeans it's not what it seems like par\ncharar P par the people of India 2/3 of\nthem did not vote for the BJP so our\nattempt was to assimilate all different\npolitical parties despite having\ndifferences and we still do but the\nattempt was to collate a coalition\ncalled India get everyone together and\nyou were questioning about Jammu Kashmir\neight seat do seat what is important is\nis the opposition coming together yes\nare we fighting to say in 10 years time\nwe want a better country with better\nnumbers in everywhere job creation\ninflation price size disparity between\nrich and poor all those issues matter to\nus so the Congress is fighting despite\nlet me tell you we are also giving up a\nlot of our seats in many states and it's\nvery tough for a political party to\nyield political space but the larger\ninterest of the country is to have a\nUnited opposition and who will become\nwhat time will tell and people will tell\nso let's wait for the elections to\nfinish and we'll speak after that no but\nno Mr pilot no my question is not\nwhether tmci i n i and U you really\ngoing to ask that no no no I I'll come\nback to the question I'm asking you the\nquestion is you know I'll tell you why\nit's not a figment of the media's\nimagination when they ask you this\nquestion it's not built up just by us\nand I'll give you the reason why you\nknow you say like you just said right\nnow that the constitution is at stake\nyou say democracy is at stake you say\nthis is the most important election that\nhas to be fought this time around in\n2024 you say it's that important but\nit's strangely not important enough for\nthe top leadership of the Congress to\ntake to the field where L SAA is\nconcerned where you want your voters to\nfight it out but you're not getting into\nthe battlefield how do you expect the\nvoter to buy into an idea that you\nyourself are not buying Mr pilot so pry\nfirst of all I did not get so\nmelodramatic I didn't use those words\nthat you did I was saying that we feel\nthe systems have been challenged and we\nneed to have a counterbalance in a\ndemocracy and opposition is almost as\nimportant as the government so as an\nopposition we are within our rights to\nask questions to ask for transparency\nask for debate discussions should we not\nask question why 147 MPS were suspended\nin a single day and bills were passed\nshould we not ask why Supreme Court has\nruled against so many things the\nElectoral bonds for example should we\nnot ask what happened in chandigar when\nthe Supreme Court had to intervene these\nare important things and we must qu nip\nthem at the bud who's going to do that\nunfortunately it's not going to be the\nmedia it has to be the opposition so\nplease when you ask me what we are doing\nI am committed to what I'm saying so is\nmy party and just for the record so is\nIndia Alliance we will fight and we will\nwin our strategy who will contest who\nwill fight how many seats that's up to\nus and we'll take a call on that no you\nyou're willing to you should actually\nask all those questions but this session\nhas exactly to do with me asking\nquestions on what's right or wrong with\nthe India Alliance whether you have your\nnarrative right whether you have your\nstrategy right therefore the biggest\nquestion that your voter the number that\nyou entailed earlier is asking you that\nwen't you fighting and I want to come\ndown to you Ai and and give and I'll\ngive you an analogy which my colleague\nrajdeep uses very often where Cricket is\nconcerned you know this is the the most\nimportant match you're fighting the\nWorld Cup final you have India versus\nPakistan would you get your benchers\nwho've been warming the benches to fight\nit out or will the opening act be a\nsuchin pilot asoke gelot aesi arind\nkajal Rahul Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi\nyou've chosen not to do\nso so I think prey first of all every\nparty and every Alliance is bound to\nhave its own strategy so what is our\nstrategy for selecting our candidates is\nnot something that is going to be\ndiscussed in the India today conclave\nbut yes we have all chosen our\ncandidates to win the seats that we are\nfighting because it is a Do or Die\nbattle for us and I don't think it's a\nDo or Die battle Just For Us in terms of\nthe parties who are represented here or\nthe people who are sitting here I think\nthat this election is a Do or Die battle\nfor this country it's a Do or Die battle\nfor the constitution of this country and\nI think that is really what is at stake\nin this 2024 elections and I cannot\nunderline it more you look at every\nDemocratic institution in this country\none by one one by one they are all being\neroded I me until a few days back we\nused to talk about the central Election\nCommission being eroded we used to talk\nabout uh income tax department CBI ined\ntoday with this entire electoral bonds\nmatter you now see that the biggest\nnationalized bank of this country the\nState Bank of India has just become\nanother arm of the BJP you now see the\nfact that the CBI and Ed are not just\nputting the opposition Party leaders\ninto jail but they have become like you\nknow we used to see those Bollywood\nmovies bomb\nDawn protection\nM this is exactly what is happening in\nour country you sent CBI and Ed after\nthe biggest businesses of the country\nand as soon as they get raided by it\nDepartment by CBI by Ed within one week\nthey hundreds of cores of electoral BS\nso the fact is that today Ed and CBI\nhave\nbecome\nbond that is the state of the\nConstitution of our country that is the\nstate of the Democracy of this country\nand I think it is important that all of\nus understand that this is the battle\nthat we are all fighting but you I'll\nCircle back back to the question and I'm\nsorry because I'm going to ask you that\nagain before I move on if it is a Do or\nDie battle then why is it that the India\nalliance's top leadership is not willing\nto do or die you know why isn't it so\nbig for you to actually put your name on\nthat ticket why isn't a natachi fighting\nyou fought the last time in 2019 are you\nfighting this time ma no but what what\nmakes you think that we haven't put our\nbest foot forward every party I mean I\ncan definitely speak for my own party is\nthat when we choose candidates there are\nmultiple considerations at stake right\nso you are going to choose as per that\nparticular parliamentary constituency\nwho is your most winnable candidate now\nthat most winnable candidate may not\nnecessarily be the person that you see\non India today conclave it can be very\nmany other people who are leaders of our\nparty who might whom you might not know\nof I think that we have put forward very\nstrong candidates in Delhi and uh I am\nvery hopeful that at least the four\ncandidates that we have fielded in Delhi\nare going to be winners\neven in Punjab we have fielded five of\nour sitting cabinet ministers now is\nthat not heavyweight enough for you no\nno it's not that you know all I'm just\nsaying is if there was an Arwin krial\nfighting from New Delhi would be\ndifferent but fine I get what you're\nsaying but you know sain I want to get\nyou back into this conversation Mr pilot\nand that comes from you know when you're\njust\ntalking I'm not trying to pin the India\nAlliance down but we're talking about\nthe narrative and of the India Alliance\nand is if there is a cohesive strategy\nor not do you you sense that there's\nbeen a lack of urgency because I'll give\nyou an example 267 seats have been\nannounced of the BJP or less than 100\nright now of course you're not fighting\nas many seats as the BJP so that is\ndebatable but in terms of you know\ngetting your act together because till\nNovember the India Alliance looked\npromising you know it was coming\ntogether it was cohesive you had these\nmultiple committees none of those\ncommittees have met and you know see\nwhere you are today do you at least\naccept that there was a lack of urgency\nand getting things together I fail to\nunderstand PR please explain this to me\nthe race of who will announce the\ncandidates first that becomes a\nparameter of you judge the urgency\nelections announced today and we all\nknow when the nominations are going to\nbe filed we are fighting on every state\nwith some alliances it takes time to\nnegotiate as far as the narrative is\nconcerned I think the narrative is\nalready set we didn't have to set it the\nnarrative is is the government of the\nday which has been there for 10 years\nwithout any Coalition pressure what they\nhad promised to the people of India of\ndoubling the farmers income of giving 2\nCR jobs a year of reducing poverty\nreducing inflation have they checked all\nthose boxes have they delivered what\nthey themselves committed to that is the\nnarrative The Narrative is in today's\nIndia you know just casting a vote and\nhaving elected a government that's not\ndemocracy democracy is that every\ninstitution must be credible transparent\nand should have the faith of the people\ndemocracy is then you have a healthy\ndebate when the parliament functions\nwhen there is a playing field for all\npolitical parties involved when\nstakeholders can say something so that\nis a narrative it's not about Congress\nwinning losing India allance winning\nlosing today in India these elections\nare important because the people of\nIndia want to see a credible road map as\nan alternative and we are the ones\nproviding that and might I just say\nIndia Alliance has many partners in his\nfold right we are still talking figuring\nout names and we will do it very soon\nbut ban India the Congress Remains the\nonly political party that can actually\ngive a formidable challenge to the BJ BP\nnationally every state has leaders and\nparties which are very important for us\nequal Partners no big and small but\nnationally it is the Congress that can\nactually across the length and breath of\nIndia take on the BJP and defeat them\nwe've done it before we'll do it again\nis there at least acceptance because\nboth you know U both uh Mr Abdullah and\naashi sitting right next to you through\nthe course of those four five months\nwhen you were fighting those elections\nin madhya Pradesh in Rajasthan there was\na sense that you could have at that\npoint of time you were buying time if\nyou would have started working at that\npoint of time in building your alliance\nbolstering your narrative things would\nhave been different you wanted to wait\nout that result and then take on it's\nnot easy prey to fight a state election\nwith a party and then come and talk to\nthem about negotiating seats it's very\ndifficult for political parties but we\nsee the larger objective we see our\ninterest today in the state is important\nbut the national interest is much larger\nand like Omar was saying we whether it's\nwe fight one seat less you fight two\nseat more in the end of the day these\nare details end of the day when you look\nback on 4th of June we want the India\nAlliance and all like manded parties to\nget a majority now I may fight two seats\nfour seats less or more that's not\nimportant of course in negotiations we\nalways go to the brink But ultimately\nthe objective is to field one toone\ncandidates against the BJP and NDA and\nwe are really almost there in our Target\nin terms of achieving that in most\nStates you know Mr Abdullah many times\nuh um you know with that one odd sound\nbite to television channels one can\nsense a possible disillusionment and a\nfrustration with the India Alliance I'll\ntake you back you know to last year in\nJanuary there was this one picture and\nthat would go against because if there\nis something that the India Alliance has\nto say it is carried this know if you\ncan just turn back was the cover page of\nmost uh Mr Abdullah newspapers the next\nday you know that has you that has Mr\nMiss Muti that has Priyanka that has\nRahul Gandhi of course Mr K right so\nthis\npicture exactly a year ago in Kashmir\nyou were there um gave out a sense of\npotential possible hope and this was a\nyear back that it was all coming\ntogether you know in paths and pieces\nand the entire game plan and the\nnarrative was being formed is there\ndisillusionment a sense of\ncynicism where amongst of of maybe you\nknow the Congress going too slow\ndragging its feet could have done better\nso many committees not one has met no I\ndon't think uh the Congress is to blame\nfor everything that has gone wrong with\nthe India Alliance and let's face it\nthere have been uh hiccups along the way\nuh the recent uh State elections uh the\nlack of clarity as to whether the India\nAlliance would fight those elections\ntogether or not uh that hurt us uh in\nthe India Alliance meetings before those\nelections all the uh parties that belong\nto those States they all wanted some\nclarity as to whether we would fight\ntogether or not uh the ultimate decision\nwas that we wouldn't fight together and\nas suchin rightly pointed out uh that\nwas a bit of a problem because having\nfought elections against each other just\na few months ago to get uh sort of seat\nsharing sorted out now takes a little\nbit of time uh but otherwise other than\nnitish Kumar G leaving I think the India\nAlliance uh contrary to a lot of other\nexpectations has done reasonably well\nnow as far as this Photograph you're\nshowing what has changed in this\nPhotograph I have I haven't seen anybody\nwho's in this Photograph announced that\nthey've left the indiai the photograph\nhas changed Mr Abdullah maybe at that\npoint of time you know it's the it's the\nT-shirt but you trying a bit hard with\nwith the white T-shirt is concern and\nrahul's beard is longer I had a bit more\nhair under my hat but other than that if\nyou just look at the constituents of the\nIndia Alliance there none of them have\ndisassociated themselves from the India\nAlliance no I'll tell we have we have we\nhave sort of I'd like to believe we have\nmore or less successfully concluded a\nseat sharing with the Congress so so I\nmean where where is the disillusionment\nwhere is the problem you know as a Puli\nI'll tell you where it's coming from\nbecause right after that picture where\nboth of you were walking in that white\nT-shirt well you know interesting choice\nbecause you matched it with Rahul I\ninterviewed you if you remember and at\nthat point of time in that interview you\ngave me a timeline and you said If by\nNovember we don't figure it out we're in\ntrouble it's yes and and as I said then\nwe we we did hit we did hit a roadblock\nwe hit a roadblock with the with with\nthe state elections uh I was one of\nthose who in the meeting said that look\nwe need Clarity we need to understand\nwhether we're fighting assembly together\nor is the India Alliance only for\nParliament so I'm I'm I'm quite sort of\nclear in this that not fighting the\nassembly elections together didn't do us\nany favors I mean if you look at the\nnumbers ra Sachin will know Rajasthan\nmuch better than I do but when you start\ncompiling the vote share and you join\nthe smaller parties that fought against\nthe Congress and put together suddenly\nyou find that the congress with all\nthose people would have actually been in\na position to form the government rather\nthan the BJP so there are there are\nlessons to be learned but uh as far as\nthe the the this Parliament election\nthat's coming up look I'll be honest\nwith you I didn't expect a seat sharing\narrangement in in up I did not think the\nCongress and the samajwadi party would\nbe able to come together in in up but\nthey seem to have truth be told I did\nnot expect the arm admy party uh to give\nup seat in Delhi I really didn't we\nalways felt that I mean internally when\nwe talked that if the India Alliance had\na problem it would have it in West\nBengal it would have it in Delhi we\nstill have one in West Bengal uh but\nfortunately we don't have one in Delhi\nat the moment well true but you know\nthere has to be some amount of\nacceptance AI because through the last 6\nmonths every time we had Mr krial speak\nafter one of those meetings in where\nhe'd\nsay there was a sense of\nfrustration no I think there's not\ndenying that uh there's not denying both\nthe facts first of all the fact that\nIndia Alliance came together and has\nstayed together that in itself I think\nis an important achievement it's an\nimportant achievement because you have\nall of these political parties who have\ncontested elections against each other\nnot just in one state but in multiple\nStates why are we coming together we are\ncoming together because we believe that\nthere's a larger crisis in this country\na larger battle for the constitution of\nthis country but that does not make it\nvery easy to set aside the differences\nand the past relationships that these\nparties might have had so the fact that\nthe India Alliance has come together and\nstayed together apart from nitish Kumar\nG uh leaving I think is a positive but\nyes there's no denying the fact that it\nhas been slow and I think it could have\nbeen faster and I do believe that if it\nhad been faster the alliance would have\nbeen in a better position today uh but\nuh there's a saying in Hindi which says\nthey but you know I I'll bring in Mr\npilot there because yesterday we had\nthis whole shopology session and we had\nsome of the topologist of the country on\none stage and I'm not trying to pin you\ndown Mr pilot or the Congress but the\ngeneral opinion of most of theologist\nwas that Congress has been the weakest\nlink not just in terms of how they treat\ntheir allies but also possibly how they\ntreat their own and allow me and humor\nUs if pictures could speak a thousand\nwords we're going to just put the the\npicture right wait out it's coming we're\ngoing to put a picture out and then\nthere was one who's that each one of the\nmen in these pictures in this picture\nhas left the party and the general\nperception is that the party did not\ngive them the opportunity that they\ndeserved the year that they needed or\nthe call that they needed at that point\nof\ntime so what's the question the question\nis why haven't you you left\na or is it in the\noffing so I knew that at some point pry\nhas very very consciously done that ever\nsince we started talking to each other\non record but again for the nth time let\nme tell you pry anyone who makes a\nchoice to change ideology or change the\npolitical track is there independent\nindividual decision whether the\ncompulsions are there whether there is\npressure whether there's allurement I'm\nnot to say that's their own choice but\nwhoever leaves and does something else\nsome of party uh whether the decision is\nright or wrong the final judgment will\nbe time and voters they will be the\nfinal people who will say\nwhether as far as we are concerned in\nthe congress party if you think that the\nBJP is so confident of getting 350 70 80\nwhatever then why are they picking on\nevery opposition leader they trying to\nPi every party every leader they trying\nto get themselves if they were so\nconfident why would they want you know\nall the Congress\nleaders Dynasty nepotism Congress why\nyou taking them\nthen and you never ask me you asking me\nwho's left X MLA X Minister\nXMP\nwork both ways if you are saying to me\nthat Congress men are leaving join BJP\ntwo sitting loab MPS have joined the\ncongress party but pilot what do you I'm\nnot trying to pin you down session\nnarrative or\nstrategy but one quick question\nall of these that you see in the picture\nin there's no Ed Case CBI somewhere down\nthe line do you at least accept the\nparties let them down they could have\nstayed in the fold yeah everyone has\ntheir own story please ask each of them\nwhen you meet them next time what their\nstory was we were colleagues we still\nare but different parties whether their\ndecision is right or wrong people will\ndecide people will say so each one makes\ntheir decision regarding to their lives\nand what path they want to follow uh\nit's not for me to comment on what they\ndid obviously when anyone leaves the\nparty a small worker block president\nDistrict president he feel\nsad but that decision but to say that\nonly people are leaving the Congress and\nnot joining the party there are many\npeople in Telangana and Karnataka\nRajasthan harana and listen one more\nthing PR I mean not trying to pin you\ndown either but what goes up must come\ndown and cycle of time in the wheel will\nturn so one has to stay on and fight the\ngood fight to wait make sure when the\nclock turns you're there with full\nstrength is Mr pilot fighting the good\nfight in the Lok saaba this\ntime whatever my party decides on me\nI've done that and I'll do it in the\nfuture also all right you know the other\nissue where it comes down to the\nnarrative and the strategy um where\nthere seems to be a problem is that it's\nan inorganic Alliance that um it's for\nsurvival possibly not stability it's\nanti-modi not proter that's the\nperception and why I say that is on\nmajor key issues let's talk about uh Mr\nAbdullah let's talk about 370 the three\nparties that are sitting on stage each\nof this polit these political parties\nhas a very different stand on 370 you\nhave the arm admi party which outrightly\nsupported the Modi government we have\nyou who've called it unconstitutional\nthe Congress till date has been\ncompletely ambiguous on what their stand\nis where 370 is concerned so do you\nsomewhere down the line there um you\nknow is Credence to the question that\nthis is an inorganic Alliance it's for\nsurvival not stability look if anything\nI think that's the beauty duty of the\nalliance that on on some issues we agree\nto disagree but it hasn't pulled us\napart yes it's a fact I disagree with\nwith with the position that the arm admy\nparty took on the 5th August of 2019 yes\nI feel the Congress could have done more\nto protect uh its own I mean 370 was The\nInheritance that the Congress gave the\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir so yes there\nare issues on which we we we disagree\nbut I think in terms of of uh the the\nbroad issues the the need as AI rightly\npointed out to protect the Constitution\nto protect democracy to protect the idea\nof India to protect the the the secular\nethos of India that is the India that we\nwere born into that is the idea of India\nthat we came to understand now these are\nall ideas that we we solidly behind the\nfact that the economy needs to do better\nthe fact that rural distress is a\nreality even though it goes unreported\nthe fact that there are there are a\nnumber of of educated youngsters who\nfind it difficult to get jobs all these\nare real factors uh that that need to be\naddressed I think the one mistake that\nwe make from time to time that we need\nto address and it was part of your\nquestion this whole thing that we are\nseen to be anti-modi I think that's a\nmistake because every time we sort of\nlaunch a personal attack against the\nPrime Minister it boomerangs on us these\nit it does not work and and I'm telling\nyou from experience it does not work so\nyou think parivar wad was a blunder\nparad was a blunder yes it was CH chore\ndoesn't work adani Amani doesn't work it\ndoesn't work let's accept it I think the\nmessage that we have to take to the\npeople is not that the Prime Minister\nhas done something because I mean for\nwhatever reason the man seems to be\nquoted in Teflon nothing that you say\nStakes I mean it's a fact like it or not\nit's a fact I'll come back to that so no\nso the I mean but who can deny that the\nBJP has got richer you cannot make a\ncase that the Prime Minister has because\nthere's no evidence to support that he\nhas but there is every evidence to\nsupport that while the rest of India or\na large part of India has got poorer the\nBJP has got a damsite\nricher I mean almost 50% of the\nElectoral bonds went to them so I mean\nthese are these are sort of campaign\nstrategies that we need to uze the BJP\nis only way glad that we limit it to\nModi Teflon quoted there are many lay to\nit we'll come back to that but I want to\npull in um arashi this conversation\nwhere we talk about why it's in in\norganic Alliance like we spoke of how\nthere are very three different takes\nwhere it comes down to 370 but at to get\nyou in on this you know how is it going\nto work is going to campaign in ch and\nask\nfor then is going to be standing init\nand say\ncongress the voters\nconfus so there is a bit of uh you know\npry let me assure you about one thing if\nthere is one thing the Indian voter is\nnot it is confused the Indian voter\nknows their mind they know where to vote\nwhom to vote for what their candidate\nstands for what their party stands for\nso I think the Indian voter you cannot\nconfuse them there is a lot of clarity\nthat the Indian voter has and they vote\nwith their minds and they give their\nverdict very clearly if you're asking\nthat why is it that we have not Allied\nin Punjab but we have Allied in Delhi I\nthink that it's very clear that every\nAlliance has its own Dynamics in Punjab\nspecifically neither the congress party\nnor the arm admy party leadership in the\nstate was ready for an alliance so I\nthink that uh that is something that we\nas a political party have to respect\nhaving said that of course we have\ncontested elections against the Congress\nwe have amadm party was formed in a\nbattle against the rightly you've earned\nyour Spurs at the back of taking them\nfrom Mr pilot\nno so in fact we we were formed as a\nparty our first major electoral battle\nin Delhi in 2013 was against the\ncongress party but the fact of the\nmatter today is that there are bigger\ndangers to the country that we see today\nand that is the reason why it is\nimportant that this Alliance comes\ntogether I may have my differences with\none party I may have my differences with\nthe second party but as I said we all\nwant to protect the constitution of this\ncountry and it is no it is no small\nthing today on WhatsApp you would have a\nlot of messages circulating and you look\nat why why I say that the democracy is\nin danger there's enough number of\npeople who will tell you that if BJP\ncomes back to Power there's never going\nto be any elections in Delhi ever again\nfor example if BJP comes back to Power\nthere's going to be no other political\nparty so this is exact the fact that\nthis is already circulating and in this\nWhatsApp University is an indicator of\nthe directions that the ruling party of\nthis country is thinking of the fact is\nthat now there was a time when you would\nhave rigging of Elections I remember\nwhen we were kids we'd\nhear but tell me what is it if it's not\nrigging of Elections if you put all your\nopposition Party leaders in jail what is\nit if it's not rigging of Elections if\nyou freeze the bank account of your\nmajor opposition party a few weeks\nbefore the election is around what is it\nif it's not election rigging if you're\nusing CBI and Ed to make sure that no\nother political party gets funding and\nyou get all the Electoral funding there\nis you know I'm going I'm running out of\ntime I'm also MC so I understand we have\ntwo minutes say how will she ask for\nvotes for congress how will BJP ask vote\nfor nitish Kumar when they go to biar\nthat's how you know what I'm going to do\nis I'll allow you the three of you one\nminute each because we've tried to tear\napart on whether the India Alliance has\na narrative or the lack of it but what\nis the alternative that you offer\nbecause you say this is wrong with the\nModi government right this is wrong with\nthe BJP what's the alternate that you\noffer because at least if you look at\nthe messaging you have a face in place\nwith the Prime Minister number one you\nhave messaging in terms of vixit bhat\nwhere he's talking about not just now\nbut what's going to happen in 2047 you\nhave hinda to go with it somewhere down\nthe line neither do you have a face and\nthe messaging is a bit mixed up right\nnow so one minute what's the alternate\nVision I talk about my party I think the\nmessaging is very clear messaging is\nthat this country deserves an elected\ngovernment that respects the opposition\nthat encourages debate and discussion\nthat does not use agencies at its whims\nand fancies India deserves a government\nwhere we have promised that we will\nactually have an legal law for MSP we\nare a party that is opening ourselves\nfor transparent discussions we want to\nopen liberal campuses\nwe want all of that and we saying it\nthere is a better credible alternative\nwill the India Alliance touch 100 well\nthe Congress sorry will the Congress\ntouch 100 this time we are looking at\n272 plus was here last night he said\nwhat come he can say whatever I'm saying\nIndia Alliance 272 plus 272 plus okay\nyou're forming government then as for\nyou okay if you you know I I'll get you\nin Mr Abdullah first in terms of\nmessaging let's talk about the ca if you\nare because you have a very strong\nposition on the ca\nyou call it divisive in The Malley but\nyour ally will be fighting it out in\njamu so what's the alternate that they\nshould fight on where you are not called\na party or an alliance of\nappeasement how is protecting the\nConstitution\nappeasement the Constitution asks you to\ntreat all as equal that you should not\ndistinguish on the basis of cast Creed\nor religion does the ca not distinguish\non the basis of religion forget Muslims\nthere there's no place for Jews there's\nno place for bahis there are there are\nentire communities that are left out now\nif your Constitution asks you to treat\nall as equal the ca certainly doesn't so\nI don't understand how being against the\nCAA is being divisive in fact if\nanything being against the CAA means you\nwant to unite\neverybody do you have a number\n272 I a very small politician belonging\nto a very small part of Jammu and\nKashmir which thanks to this government\nhas become even smaller after the 5th\nAugust\n2019 I know only five\nseats and in those five seats the\nmajority will come to the India Alliance\nyou have no confidence in your ally\nwho's sitting right next to I have all\nconfidence I have no I have all\nconfidence in them otherwise I wouldn't\nbe part of the India Alliance I just\ndon't know enough about the rest of the\ncountry uh to stick my neck out in front\nof such a wide audience I'll confine\nmyself to what I know about AI the\nalternate Vision don't say what's wrong\nwith the Modi government what is it that\nyou have to offer and your number and we\ngoing to close it then I think I have a\noneline vision for this election that\nlet this election not be the last\nelection that we are having in this\ncountry that is what we are fighting for\nin this 2024 elections and do you have a\nnumber\nAI am admy party is contesting 20 odd\nseats I think it would be a bit arrogant\nof us to talk about a number across the\ncountry\nNational\nParty you you talking about's party came\nout of opposition to the congress party\nbut can I proudly say that almost all\npolitical parties have come out of the\ncongress party so by opposing us in one\nelection doesn't mean we cannot hold\nhands for the next future elections the\ntruth is they have to pull their weight\nthe fact is that most of our sort of uh\nexpectations are from the congress\nparty because there are there are what\njust 300 seats Mr abdah that's the money\nshot of this if I could say there are\nthere are almost 300 seats in which is\nis a direct contest between the Congress\nand the BJP in the last election the\ncongress's strike rate was under 10%\nexactly that strike rate needs to go up\nso yes 27 272 is definitely realistic\nI'm not saying it your ally is saying it\nwe we've all said we will deliver the\nmajority of our seats and we hope the\nCongress will do the same and we are\nthen pass the the don't forget 2004\nIndia shining no expected vajay to lose\nbut people of India are smart they will\nvote with full wisdom and I have\nconfidence that we'll get the majority\nrequired well we don't know if it's a\nModi Shining Moment yet but we're going\nto leave it at that but when it comes\ndown to preparation for an election two\nyears back the BJP is focusing on 167\nseats all of those are weak seats not\nstrong seats each of the cabinet\nministers responsible for three of those\nweak\nseats let's see how the exam goes U and\nlet's hope that the India Alliance also\ngets it act together I'm not saying it\nyour your allies it right next to you\nbut I do wish you well may the best man\nwin and uh lots of luck to the India\nAlliance going ahead thank you so much\nwith all three of you for joining us\nthank you for taking the questions thank\nyou I appreciate\nit thank you very much can I request\nsandip Gupta of the motwani jera\nfoundation to please come up on stage\nand hand over a token of our\nappreciation to aishi Omar Abdullah and\nsain pilot\nplease a big round of applause for our\npolitical panelist here ladies and\ngentlemen\n[Music]\nthank you for being so sporting all\nthree of\nyou thank\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nlook\n[Music]\ne\ne\nbe\nseated I'd like to invite on stage Miss\nKip Puri Vice chairperson and executive\neditor-in chief of India Today group to\ndeliver the vote of\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nthanks\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\ngood evening\neveryone we live in an age where there's\nan economy on distraction and a complete\nCorruption of\nattention tell me everything the juice\nthe Nuance the details and you got 8\nseconds that's how long readers viewers\ntake to swipe to the next big thing and\nhere's some trivia we scroll 30 cm every\n5 seconds in a week your thumb has\nscrolled 2.7 km pretty good workout so\ndon't worry I'm going to be quick before\nyou swipe me right I can't imagine a\nmore exciting but challenging time to be\nrunning a media\norganization we have two Divergent Mega\nTrends pulling in opposite directions\none the empowerment by social media that\nhas brought about a liberalization of\nthe freedom of expression these new\ntools have given voice to large sections\nof society in India which earlier went\nunheard\nunintentionally so many alternative\nfacts and truths are Avail available but\nthe second Mega trend is we do have very\nhighly shortened attention\nspans you have a lot more Nuance but\nnobody wants to listen so someone is\nalways going to feel unheard and\nignored so what is and what should be\nthe role of a media organization in a\ntime like this is anyone with a camera\nand a Twitter and a YouTube account a\nmedia organization is he a\njournalist what is unbiased information\nthese days one person's terrorist is\nanother's Freedom Fighter one person's\ntruth is another's lie how do you\ndistill what ethical standard of\nself-regulation are we talking about\nwhen pass by live stream an accident or\ngive away a rape victim's\nname what can you do about the fact that\nsome media now Prides itself in\nexplaining the government's point of\nview with well argued fight well argued\nfacts and graphics and they do it\nwithout any pressure from the government\nare they\nindependent are they media are they\npropaganda also if you're always\nanti-government are you independent\nwhat's the role of media organizations\nin this new augmented fragmented\nfiltered reality is a question I grapple\nwith a lot I think as always the truth\nlies somewhere in the middle I believe\nthe new role of responsible media is to\nbuild Bridges bridges across the right\nand the left we don't subscribe to the\ntribalization of news the US versus them\nprison this doesn't just mean being\nmiddle of the road I believe we need to\nactively come up with innovative ways to\npierce holes into partisan Echo Chambers\nso they see a tiny bit of light from the\nother side to create a more diverse\npolitical\nlistening because supporting one highly\npolarized truth may help social media\nalgorithms make for smoother News Room\nand fatter bottom lines but they don't\nhelp the social fabric of our country a\nYale and Berkeley study concluded that\neven the most loyalist news audience can\nchange their mind when exposed to\ndifferent facts and perspectives our\nwhole attempt is to bring our audience\nfrom extremes to a place of\nconstructive\ndisagreement my whole team is built on\ntill death do us sorry till built to\nargue till death do us apart and as the\nexecutive editor-in Chief I get the fun\njob of dealing with a newsroom full of\nstrongly opinionated argumentative\nrebellious questioning hustling\nindividuals which is all the\ncharacteristics of a good\njournalist you have seen so many of them\non this stage in the last two days doing\ntheir thing we are not afraid to ask\nquestions our Newsroom is built on\ndissent and uneasy peace if you like and\nI would not have it any other way I\nthink it makes us better more\nperspectives the merrier makes our\nstories more\ncalibrated I see some disapproving heads\nover there calibrated you're right every\nmedia in this country is right before\nyou make your decision do con consider\nthis the media cannot play the role of\nthe opposition expecting it to do that\nleads to unfair charges of godi or Modi\nmedia if the opposition is in disarray\nthe media cannot be blamed for it we\ncannot present an other side equally\nstrongly if it doesn't\nexist we are observers in this boxing\nmatch we are not the players if one side\nis weak or doesn't show up we cannot\njump into the ring this is not faar this\nis a matter of rules roles and\ncompetence we are the medium we are not\nthe message secondly our role as media\nis to take you as close to the primary\nsource of information as we can not Six\nDegrees of Separation but two we hope\nyou saw that in the last 2 days and\nwe'll hear from the mea and PM this\nevening straight from the ground or the\nnewsmaker with minimum loss in\ntransition and\ntranslation clean Last Mile of\ninformation and we always focus on that\nthere are conclaves Galore and we're\nsandwich between many of them ourselves\nbut I think for the reasons reasons\nabove we are\ndifferent so as we get into election\nmode and we see the great intoxication\nand toxification of news do choose your\nnew source your leader and your conclave\nvery wisely the last two days you have\nmade the right choice baby so thank you\npartners for your generous sponsorship\nfeedback and support and thank you as\nalways all of you for sharing with us\nyour most precious possession your time\nand your attention\ngood\n[Music]\nevening\n[Music]\nhe\ne\nG20 order and it's our honor and\npleasure to invite on stage here the\nIndia Today conclave Dr s j Shanker\nUnion minister of external\nAffairs also on stage our session\nmoderator shivar and Gita\n[Music]\nmoan\nso clearly I don't need to introduce our\nnext guest uh it's not often that uh a\nrockstar welcome is reserved for a\nminister but not surprising at all we've\nseen this many many times uh uh I have a\npicture that's very representative of\nthe kind of Applause we just heard Dr J\nShankar first of all welcome to the\nIndia today\n[Applause]\nconclave not only has this picture\nspawned a million memes and you see it\neverywhere you go on social media but\nyou know for a minister uh whose every\nword social media hangs on to uh\neverything goes viral it really doesn't\nhurt if you look like this because it\njust goes way way wider so I'm going to\nstart with that image let's keep that\nimage there because I you know not that\npeople haven't seen it enough but I want\nto keep that image on the screen Dr J\nShankar it's not just a meme it's not\njust an image the things you say as\nIndia's external affairs minister\nresonate in the media in on social media\nthe things you say apart from just your\nforeign policies and the decisions\nyou've taken your images go viral as\nwell what does that virality mean to you\nso how do you read that virality it's\nnot every day that you see this kind of\nthing that's why I ask look that's\nthat's a very unfair question to start\nwith you know I mean\nuh I just try to be myself and not\nalways like that uh but uh you know uh\nthe the point is today if want think\nabout it you know to be India's foreign\nminister at a time when we are rising uh\nwe are if you use any metric economy\ninfluence uh all of that uh and quite\nhonest ly to be a foreign minister in a\nModi government you\nknow it it kind of sets your behavioral\nuh approach does it does it uh uh you\nknow are you aware that there is this\nlarge audience hanging on to everything\nthat you're saying and you know\napplauding all the things you say oh\nthere's another J Shankar Zinger you\nknow he said something 30 seconds 30\nseconds from a 1 hour speech will just\ngo crazy viral millions of views are you\naware of that when you speak I I I think\nyou got to keep it in proportion okay uh\nso what you know actually if you look at\nit what has been happening is we've been\nputting out our narrative our case our\narguments and the world's been The Last\n5 Years unusually contentious and\neffervescent you know things are\nhappening things are happening people uh\nmake points strongly and you end up in\nsituations where you you hold your\nground or you contest it or you counter\nit or you so it's it's very you know\nit's it's a product of circumstances\nproduct of times I would say okay come\non shev four decades in diplomacy 5\nyears in uh politics let's bring him\ninto his comfort zone China so there's a\nmassive challenge but also opportunity\nities uh you have tried to manage the\nrelationship with China it's been\ndifficult uh not just for India but\nacross the world uh one of the biggest\nchallenges for the world today is China\nand the growing aggression of China in\nmany parts of the world not just in our\nregion how do you look at tackling China\nhandling China and how do you see taking\nthat challenge forward in uh the next\nnext government should you\nwin uh look I would say G the first\nthing is we have to stop pretending that\neverything is nice stop being uh worried\nto express what we feel uh stop using\nterminology which doesn't work for us\nmay work for them so I think being\nstraight being public being upfront\nuh is the starting point now the fact is\nuh it's not today or I mean I I agree\nsince 2020 the relationship has become\nmuch more complicated I accept that but\nit was building up over a period of time\nyou know uh and what was happening was\nuh because we weren't uh honest about it\neven to ourselves uh we weren't really\nreally uh articulating it and frankly\neven\nstrategizing uh accordingly you know uh\nI mean there was a time when we actually\nsaid China is a strategic\npartner I mean if I were to today say\nthis to anybody people would be baffled\nbut yet that was the official\ndescription at one point of time so the\nfirst thing is we've got to recognize\ntoday that we have uh really in a way a\nvery challenging competitive neighbor uh\nthere are serious issues over a period\nof time in our history many of those\nissues are have not been resolved some\nhave aggravated uh it isn't just a\nboundary issue uh there are you know we\nhave common neighbors we have a common\nperiphery there is competition there uh\nthere are very major economic issues\nthat and and when you say what do we do\nas I said for a start we've got to be\nhonest about it we've got to call out\nthings when they go wrong but we also\nneed to prepare you know and the\npreparation a lot of it has to be uh the\ndomestic preparation I mean if you are\ndealing with the China you got to have\nan economy which is which is uh geared\nup for it now we have for example it's\nonly in the last decade we have paid\nattention to manufacturing now because\nof the neglect of manufacturing we you\nknow we started our economic reforms 30\nyears ago but we didn't take it into the\nmanufacturing world so we have these uh\nyou know uh vulnerabilities or these\ngaps uh which uh make it very uh you\nknow make it very challenging to compete\nso we've got to get all those things\nright so you have to diagnose\nit you got to prepare for it and then\nyou have to express it and you have to\nmanage it because you also don't want it\nyou know uh sort of going completely\na Dr Janka just to push the China\nquestion uh a step further uh it'll soon\nbe four years like you like you said\nfrom 2020 things have uh have gone South\nuh the military standoff turns four in\njust a few weeks from now sir uh can you\ntell uh you know there have been many\nrounds of military level talks uh and it\nappears it has appeared for a while now\nthat the reality is that the uh you know\na resolution of this entire thing is\ngoing to have to be diplomatic can you\ntell us how the next government will\nresolve this sir because it's a big\nmilitary standoff that's been on for\nfour years now well\nuh uh I would say the the scenario that\nI uh I can\nforesee has been that uh you know they\nhave uh today mased a very large number\nof troops along the Lac so have we as a\ncounter\ndeployment uh the resulting situation uh\nuh and you saw that uh you know in a way\nunfortunately go wrong in galwan uh is\nwhen troops are very close up uh there\nare all the uh dangers you associate uh\nwith that uh so the focus in the\nmilitary discussions has been uh really\nabout uh uh disengagement so that very\nclose up uh deployment of troops because\nremember both of us are very forward\ndeployed this is not where you know in\nthe last many decades was our natural uh\ndeployment uh so how do we resolve that\nhow do we do it in a manner in which uh\nit works for both of us there are issues\nrelated to petring uh because you know\nwhen you are deployed that close up then\nthere are patrolling issues obstruction\nissues uh the workaround issues all of\nwhich uh adds to a very complicated\nmetrics uh thereafter there is a uh\nthere's the next round of issues which\nis really what you would call\ndeescalation which is the fact that both\nsides uh we as as a reactive posture uh\nhave brought very large number of troops\nwith Weaponry very very close up uh so I\nthink there there a lot to it uh and and\nuh clearly it is something where we have\nto be both uh patient but also very\npersevering okay um let's zoom out a\nlittle we are yet to solve tensions uh\nin our own region but India is indeed\nplaying a key role as Peacemaker in\nother parts of the world a major role\nwhen it comes to how um the world is\nlooking to India uh for mediation Russia\nUkraine the situation there Israel Hamas\nWar the situation there but a very\nspecific question Dr J Shanker there was\na report uh which said that the United\nStates of America looked to India as\nalso China and that Prime Minister Modi\ndid avert a nuclear attack by Russia\nwill you\nconfirm uh look we have since the\nconflict in Ukraine started uh there\nhave been a number of issues in which\nwe've been involved uh we haven't uh\nbeen very public and explicit about all\nof them\nuh in many cases uh one or the other\nparty or a third party or an\ninternational\norganization has asked us to uh weigh in\nin some form uh and uh if we believe\nthat uh uh doing so was helpful because\nyou know ideally at this time I mean I I\nwould say frankly the world wants this\nconflict to end but it's not something\nthat anybody is expecting in the near\nterm\nunfortunately uh so the most sensible\nthing to do is to say okay let me at\nleast uh help to solve one part of a\nproblem or reduce one tension or relieve\none worry uh so there are there have\nbeen a lot of these situations\nuh quite honestly more than you probably\nknow uh and uh including sometimes\nfairly recent ones uh and uh you know we\nwe do what a responsible country which\nuh which is which has good relations\nwith everybody uh does but did he weigh\nin on a nuclear attack did he weigh in\ndid was there a conversation H as I said\nwe have been uh continuously doing you\nknow doing whatever we can to to reduce\ntension to reli worries to see that\nthings don't happen which make it worse\nI can tell you he's not you can't take\nthe Diplomat out of Dr J yeah you're not\ngoing to get him to say we averted a\nnuclear attack okay let's let's move\nfrom Russia Ukraine now to the uh the\nIndian Ocean Dr J Shankar where uh you\nknow with the Red Sea with the Fallout\nof what's happened uh between Israel and\nGaza there's been a very positive\nSpotlight on India and its role uh in\nthe Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean\nwe're also seeing uh you know an\nelevated level of aggression from the\nChinese whether it is in Maldives\nwhether it is elsewhere uh as far as its\nown intentions as far as the Indian\nOcean are concerned can you tell us how\nIndia is navigating this it's a complex\nshape-shifting issue uh can you tell us\nhow the next government will handle this\nthis is a situation that is likely to\nbecome a bigger churn sir well look uh I\nthink there are multiple things uh which\nare happening in the Indian Ocean uh one\npart of it as you referred to which is\nRed Sea Gulf of Eden Etc they we are uh\nin fact right now we have an ongoing\nsituation with one of our ships uh uh I\nKolkata uh so uh we are you know again\nas a responsible country uh contributing\nour bit for maritime safety security uh\ndealing with the you know uh Prospect of\ndrone and missile attacks on shipping uh\ncountering piracy and uh this is\nimportant for people in our country to\nto recognize and appreciate because the\nera when the Global Commons would be\nlooked after by other people that IR is\nnow behind us so uh countries like us\nhave to be have to weigh more be more\nactive uh to use our forces uh for for\ncommon good\nuh in a way and the Red Sea Gulf of Eden\ndeployment we have I think about 12\nships there so if you look in terms of\nnational commitment we would be among\nthe larger National presence uh uh not\nthe largest but among the larger\nNational presence out there the second\npart of it uh would be uh again if\nyou've seen the last 10 years we've been\nvery active as a first responder uh that\nwhen you have natural dis disasters you\nknow it was the Yemen Civil War uh it\nwas uh going back to 2015 a water crisis\nin mives a landslide in Sri Lanka a\ncyclone in Myanmar so where again we now\nI contrast that you know with say uh two\ndecades ago where again when we had the\ntsunami in 2004 essentially uh apart\nfrom India really much of the uh uh\nsuckur and support came from outside uh\nforces in a way so we have to see it\ncould be uh a conflict kind of situation\nit could be a natural disaster but our\nresponsibilities and our activities in\nthe region have actually grown\ntremendously uh in the last uh decade\nthe other part of it is the Strategic\npart of it you know which is the natural\ncontestation between states uh the\ncompetition of their countries you know\nmaneuvering out maneuvering countering\nexerting influence countering that\ninfluence that is something which is\nwhich is part of the competitive nature\nof world uh politics now uh there will\nbe ups and downs that is also to be\nexpected often uh you know political\ndevelopments in one or the other country\ncan can uh impact it uh I mean looking\nback perhaps we should have been\nstrategically much more aware than we\nwere so uh for example you know when\nhamant TOA was first built I don't think\nthere was sufficient understanding in\nthis country we are talking 2008 9 10\nyou know roughly that period uh about\nthe the uh implications that it would\nhave for a country like India uh so uh\nwe are today very\naware uh we are very active uh uh if you\nlook actually you know I'm giving you a\nkind of a bureaucratic mea speak\nexplanation but you know when we\nactually had a strategy called sagur the\nwhole idea of sagur is end to end look\nat the ocean as a Consolidated space it\ncould be island States it could be the\noceans it could be a regional effort uh\ndon't deal with it in bits and pieces\nand uh be aware of your strategic\ninterests and do what you have to do to\nto safeguard it so uh these are all look\nthere's no any into it I mean uh this is\na permanent uh in objective uh of of a\ncountry for home an ocean space that is\nso approximate to it and where we have\nsuch a central spacing uh we will have\nto be continuously and persistently\nactive out there there's also concern Dr\nJ Shanker when it comes to social media\nhow um how foreign policy is decided not\ndecided in the social media space today\nsometimes it's good sometimes we have uh\nfalse narratives narratives being built\nin that space how do you look at that\nhow does one counter that in it at a\ntime when you have biases coming in\nvarious countries have their own\nperspectives uh there's hypocrisy in how\nthey see India's position on certain\nmatters that don't suit their interests\nhow does one Challenge and beat this\nwell look I am paid to fix foreign\npolicy I'm not paid to fix social\nmedia I mean no to be honest nobody can\nfix social media I mean the nature of\nthe platform is such that everything\nwhich you somewhat disapprovingly state\nis actually something which gets more\neyeballs in social media but what about\nthe biases from International uh it it\nwill happen I take it as a count look I\nI may not like it but because I don't\nlike it doesn't mean it's not going to\nhappen I assume this is a a medium which\nis uh very angular uh where you know\nwhich is very naturally given to strong\nviews where the sense of being\nresponsible for what you are posting is\nsomewhat diminished these are The Facts\nof Life with which we operate so you\ncounter it uh fairly rapidly so the days\nwhen let us say the the XP division of\nmea could sit over something for a few\nhours or a day etc those are behind us I\nmean on the run I mean sometimes we see\na tweet I mean we counter it frankly\nsometimes within minutes but Dr Janka\nyou say you're here to fix foreign\npolicy and not social media but that's a\nconstant side effect do you see that as\nuh you know a kind of affirmation from\nmillions of people who are listening to\nyou as uh you know Dr J Shanker the\nexternal Affairs Ministry you know\nbusting narratives that have prevailed\nfor a long time against India you know\nwe've seen this often uh you know\nespecially when you're abroad uh you\nknow when Western journalists have asked\nyou questions you have had answers that\nhave you know gone especially viral\nbecause it seems to bust a certain\nnarrative also the language of me has\nchanged quite a bit significantly so it\nhas well look we've adjusted to the\ntimes too you know I mean as I said it's\na reality so if it is a reality and it's\na medium where short sharp impactful\nexpressions are required then we sort of\nuh shall I say move out of our old\ncomfort zone\nand uh adjust ourselves to respond uh uh\nin that way I mean we would change and\nit is actually happening I I I see the\npoint but I you know since I cannot\nchange the nature of social media I have\nto communicate uh ideally at least\nrecognizing it but if if I could\nactually even utilizing it so that I can\nalso get ahead in the game\nby saying the right things in the right\nway so what's your sh sharp short\ninsightful reaction to the elections in\nPakistan in 30\nseconds uh does silence\n[Music]\ncount\nso okay I I hope you're not going to be\nsilent for the other election that I'm\ngoing to ask you about which is the us\nelection we'll come to the other\nelection right at the end but the US\nelection Dr J Shanker also this year uh\nalso a very interesting one to watch the\nRepublicans the Democrats Biden Trump uh\ngive us an inside view of how a system\nprepares for this kind of thing you know\ngood relations with the Biden\nAdministration with Trump as well before\nthat uh how how does the system here\nprepare for\nthis you know uh\nuh it's it's it's interesting in in two\nor three ways uh one uh because we are\nnot part of an alliance system uh we\ndon't have all the consequential issues\nthat come out of it okay because if you\nlook today at the world and uh you know\nyou listen in I was in Munich for\nexample at the security conference so\nwhen I listened into the you know the\nworries or the debates which people were\nhaving a lot of it were actually the\ndebates of the allies of America and\nthey were debating what could be the\nimplications uh if for the alliance uh\nif uh results go one way or or the other\nthe second which is uh in a way\npeculiarly us was uh you know we had a\nvery difficult time in our America\nrelationship in the\n19 7 60s definitely' 70s 80s so what\nhappened was because our challenges were\nmore with the\nadministration uh we actually uh\nconcentrated on the Congress as a way of\nengaging the American politic so over a\nperiod of time and you know this is an\naccount I've been involved with for 40\nyears we actually uh the Indian system\ndeveloped this very bipartisan way of\nworking of casting its netwide so the\nmoment anybody actually pops up on the\nAmerican political scene uh immediately\nwhat we do is to say okay that's could\nbe a governor today could be a uh you\nknow firsttime member of Congress you\ntry and reach out so it's one place\nwhere we have actually built a very uh\nvery I would say extensive culture of\nengaging and and uh uh sort of uh uh you\nknow maintaining relationships now when\nyou take that into today's America let\nus say last 10 years or so for us it's\nvery natural I mean I'm I'm not\ndisclosing any great secret that say\nbefore the well before the 2016 November\nresults we had already reached out to\nthe Trump campaign at a I mean at a high\nlevel uh and because that's the way it\nwould be and it wouldn't be you know uh\nhypothetically tomorrow let us say we\nare looking at the 20 uh 28 election uh\nif you have because you know presumably\nyou will have different people there it\nwould to me it would be completely in\norder that if there were four or five\ncandidates on each side that we would\nhave in each case\nyou know mapped out the candidate\nfigured out who are the influential\nadvisor this has become part of our uh I\nwould say our America sop uh because uh\nthat relationship is uh very important\nand to uh that is the only way you can\nactually get a grip on that\nrelationship well um which is a long way\nof telling you that we prepared for\nwhatever\nhappens\nwell talking about relations with\nAmerica or for that matter the\nAmericas um we've had some concerns um\nthe Indian side with uh the American and\nthe Canadian side when it comes to\nissues also with the Australian side but\nthe US ambassador from this very stage\nuh Dr J Shanker said uh when asked about\nthese concerns about murder For Hire\ncharges so on and so forth that it is\nnot created a bump in the relationship\nsorry what has not created a bump these\nmurder for higher charges or the issues\nwith regards to grouping panon or ner\nthat it has not created a bump but it\ncertainly is something that they're\ngoing to follow through how is India\nthen really looking at uh the concerns\nthat it has raised and the concerns that\nUS and Canada now have with India no\nlook you keep using US and Canada sort\nof seamlessly I would blow the Divide\nbecause would line there for a variety\nof reasons uh uh most notably that uh\nall sendan uh American politics has not\ngiven that kind of space uh to uh you\nknow uh violent\nextremist uh uh views and activities\nwhich Canada has done so I I don't think\nit's fair to the United States uh to to\nlump them together I I would distinguish\nuh between the two uh in terms of how\nare we dealing with it well we're\ndealing with it this way that uh yes the\nUS has shared with us uh some\ninformation some of it is in the public\ndomain so you are presumably familiar\nwith it some of it is not uh and uh our\nuh interest is to also look into it\nbecause uh you know uh to us uh there\nseems to be a very strong organized\ncrime aspect to it which also impinges\non our own security uh so uh when we\nwere apprised of this information we\ndecided uh to set up a very high\npowerered uh uh committee to look of of\ncompetent people uh to to look into it\nand that is an ongoing issue right now\nand the Americans\npart of that committee because high high\ncompetent high level\npeople\nsir okay but can I just add and ask uh\nbecause uh again from this very same\nstage US ambassador U Eric garet also\nspoke about the other concern that now\nus is raised and India said do not\ninterfere in India's internal matters\nthat's the implementation of CAA and he\nsaid that irrespective we have we share\ncertain values we have certain values\nyou can question question our imperfect\ndemocracy and we also will continue to\nMonitor and do so with regards to India\nuh the fact that the cutoff date is 2014\nand the the people who've already come\nin are already in now if we looking at\nonly Hindus siks uh pares uh Christians\nand not Muslims is it that not\ndiscriminatory is what maybe the West is\nlooking at so how do you look at the\nWestern View or how the West is looking\nat the implementation of CA\nwell look I'm not questioning uh the uh\nper imperfections or otherwise of their\ndemocracy or the principles or lack of\nit I'm questioning their understanding\nof our\nhistory okay I mean if you hear the\ncomments from uh many parts of the world\nit is as though the partition of India\nnever\nhappened you know and that there were no\nconsequential problems\nwhich the ca is supposed to\naddress so if you take a problem remove\nall the historical context from it\nsanitize it and make it into a political\ncorrectness argument and say oh I have\nprinciples and don't you have principles\nI have principles too and one of my\nprinciples is obligation to people who\nwere let down at the time of partition\nand I think home minister spoke very\neloquently on it yesterday so this\nsecond is I also have a\nproblem when people don't hold up a\nmirror to their own policies you know so\nif you say oh you are picking some faith\nand not some other faiths okay I'll give\nyou a few examples of it you know have\nyou heard of something called the\nJackson uh vanic Jackson Amendment which\nis about the Jews from Soviet Union so\nyou would ask yourself why only Jews\nthen there was the lenberg amendment\nwhich was about Christians and Jews\nagain 1989 Soviet Union uh there was the\nSpector Amendment which was a few years\nlater uh which was about bahis it was\nabout there was a there was a law which\nwas about a particular uh uh ethnicity\nfrom Vietnam who were fast tracked for\ncitizenship because they had uh uh\nfought alongside theeran an there was\nfast tracking of hungarians after the\nHungarian Revolution there's fast\ntracking of the Cubans in the 1960s so\nif you were to ask me have other\ncountries other democracies fast tracked\non the basis of ethnicity Faith social\nattributes I can give you any number of\nexamples now if I were to also say you\nknow after all why is the situation\nimportant because because very often\nwhen you have something very uh you know\nvery cataclysmic something really very\nmajor it's not possible to deal with all\nthe consequences right then and there\nand I think again yesterday Amit B\nexplained that that the leadership of\nthis country had promised to these\nminorities that if you know if you have\na problem you are welcome to come to\nIndia the leadership didn't thereafter\ndeliver on that promise now it's not\njust our predicament you know if you\nlook in Europe many European countries\nfast tracked uh the citizenship of\npeople who are left behind in the world\nwar or in some cases much before the\nworld war some historical issue which\nwas not addressed but you said I have a\nmoral obligation to that community so\nthe world is full of\nexamples and to me the context is\ntherefore very\nimportant we're out of time but uh our\naudiences would be uh quite upset with\nme if I didn't end by asking you a\nquestion that they've all asked me to\nask you Dr J Shankar which is uh we have\nour own election coming up very soon and\nthey all want to know are we going to\nsee candidate J Shankar fighting the Lo\nSAA\nelection that is not a question you\nshould ask me and I suspect it's not a\nquestion you're going to ask the next\nspeaker Dr SJ Shanker ladies and\ngentlemen thank you sir\nall right a standing ovation for Dr

    "transcript": "hi everyone so I'm looking at the\nmarkets right now and there is massive\nPanic that is going\non and all that see guys Market falling\nis a part and parcel of the entire\ninvestment Journey please figure out\nwhether you are an investor or a Trader\nif you're a Trader then don't try to\nbecome an investor and if you're an\ninvestor then behave like an investor\nnormal fall 5 7% fall on a index if we\ngo to small cap midcap the fall can be\n2x 3x more so be always prepared for a\n20% correction in the market this is a\npoint that I have been making over and\nover again over the last few months so\non that note it is very critical that\nyou protect your money if you are scared\nof investing in the stock market be\nasset Diversified so for example go to\nthe bond market I have linked some of my\nfavorite bonds you can go and check it\nout I have also linked something called\nas Market linked debenture which allows\nyou to hedge your portfolio so do check\nout the links in the description and\ncomment box it will give you more idea\nand now let's move over to the main\nvideo which will teach you fundamentals\nof investing in small cap and and why I\nam continuing to invest in this space\ndespite all the turmoil that is going on\nhi everyone welcome to today's video so\nin the last one year large caps have\nroughly given around 25% returns midap\nsmall caps have given roughly 50% return\nmicro caps have given roughly 80%\nreturns and ab over the last few months\nwhat has started to happen is that these\nassets have started to correct somewhat\ncorrection but there has been a massive\npanic in the market now for context\nlarge caps as of today when I'm making\nthis video on Thursday the large caps\nhave corrected by 6% the mid small caps\nhave corrected by 12% and micro caps\nmust have corrected by roughly around\n25% so given all this\nmath the chair has come out and said\nthat there is a bubble which is brewing\nand it is our job to curtail that bubble\nso this statement wasn't taken in the\nright spirit and there was massive\nMayhem that happened in the market on\nWednesday now because people are trying\nto dissect whatever the C chair has said\nand\nwhich means that the point in summary is\nthat see if you are a fundamental\ninvestor you understand if something is\ntruly overvalued or not or undervalued\nor\nnot right so it makes my day that during\nPanic days like these my students are\nnot panicking so that is the goal that I\nhave as a teacher and this is the same\nspirit with which I'm going to shoot\nthis video that I'm going to help you\nunderstand the opportunities in the\nsmall camp space talk about the fact\nwhether it is truly overvalued or is\nthis a great time to buy short answer is\nthat it is a great time to buy I'm\nputting some money in the market both in\ndirect equities and Via mutual fund\nroute so I will cover that aspect as\nwell very humble request that please\nwatch this entire analysis\nbecause if you don't have the time come\nback later this is a serious video I\nonly do serious videos but on a side\nnote here is an important message for my\nmom because my mom is going to say\nMarket\nso that is not the point I'm just lazy\nso I did not get the time to go and buy\nthe razor from the market maybe I'll do\nit tomorrow but this was an important\nvideo to make so here I shooting it so\nokay so let's first and foremost\nunderstand whether the small cap mid Gap\nspace right now is overvalued bubble\nbubble how do we decide it what is the\ndata that we'll look at so is the small\ncap midcap in a bubble the short answer\nis yes and also the short answer is no\nwhy am I giving you contradictory\nresponse because it depends on your time\nHorizon and let me take you to the small\ncap story so what you will see here is\nthat see from April of 23 you will see\nthat the total runup in the small cap\ncategory and this is small cap 250 which\nis an index the total runup happened to\nbe 82% literally in less than a year of\ncourse on a shortterm perspective the\nbubble is there I had covered it in the\npast I have covered it on my member\nCommunity I had explained it\ncategor but people did not understand\nand all that stuff so then what happened\nthen came phase\ntwo% 15% correction has already happened\nthis was roughly an 82% rise so yes now\nthe correction has started this is phase\ntwo which has taken place so them\nshortterm right so now what about\nmidterms so midterm we can Define\nsomewhere in like 3 to 5 years range and\na good time to start here will be\n209 that was an exceptional\nhow is it that based on the 3 to 5 year\nperiod how have the small caps performed\nso okay this data you can also pick from\nhere and you will see that on a roughly\n5e basis there has been a 200% increase\nin the small cap\ncategory context set because you know\nwhenever we speak about price\nin% people just look at the price only\nthey do not understand the Dynamics\nbehind it or the historic pattern around\nit so okay so there are two set Central\npoints that you need to know the first\nmathematical equation is nifty 50\ncollection of top 50 stocks in India if\nyou look at the returns for this the\naverage kager will come out to be\nsomewhere around 12 to 13% okay and your\nsmall cap mid gaps small and mid gaps un\nkager cagr is almost double that of 50\nand mathematically proven equation you\ncan go and time test it you can do back\ntesting and this is precisely what you\nwill find second equation is that nifty\n50 almost double just for example 100\nrupes nifty 50 will double and go to 200\nrupes in roughly 4 and a half to 5 years\nso that math how does it play out well\nsmall cap midcap on a four to 5 year\nbasis how much returns they should give\nwell they should give\n200% I have come out with this\nmathematical formula so to\nsay now then what is the total return\nthat has happened well it comes out to\nbe roughly 200% on a roughly 5year basis\nso this is not a bubble according to me\nnow different people can have different\nopinions I really respect the CB\nChairman's opinion also on this topic\nbut I'm an investor I put my own Money\nMutual mutual fund L I'm just genuinely\ntelling you whatever is happening in the\nmarket how I am looking at it now people\ncan differ but to cut the long story\nshort that from a midterm perspective\nyou can say that okay the small cap\ncategory has given a lot of run up\nabsolute shortterm definitely overvalued\nbut from a midterm perspective I it is\nnot overvalued one at Best could say\nthat this is fairly overvalued right so\nthis is an important point that you must\nunderstand now let me talk about long\nterm so if we go to longterm and\nsmall that happened in like somewhere\naround 2019\nright so we have to go to midcap\ncategory and then do proxying right so\nif you go and look at the long-term data\nthen you can look at 7 to 10 year window\nso\n2014 right so let me P up 2014 and\nsmall right so this is where we were\nright so we must be somewhere here so\n2014 and the total return over the last\nroughly 10 year basis has been\n350% for midcap\ncategory for small cap category so this\nmust be a cagr of roughly like 28\n29% right so is this overvalued on a\nlong-term basis again the short answer\nis no this is not overvalued so just\nchairman what is it that she is trying\nto say is she trying to scare the\ninvestors about the entire situation\nthat is happening I don't think that\nthat is the intent with which that\nstatement was given out people just\nstarted reading too much into\nline just look\nfor see guys basically what C Chairman's\nViewpoint was that mahad betting app\nSC there was approximately 1100 crores\nof money that was pumped into smes small\nand medium Enterprises mostly in the\nsmall cap and micro cap category now\nthis was a scam that recently broke out\ninformation is still coming in and pump\nand dumping and this pumping and dumping\nis happening in a section of small caps\nso according to my understanding what sa\nchair basically tried to communicate was\nthere is a segment within the small cap\ncategory\nproblems and that is a bubble that we\nneed to control that is my understanding\nof whatever was said so I'm just\nhighlighting it now you guys take it the\nway you want to take it so on top of\nthis let me give you some more\ncomforting data and let me share two\nvery important PE points right price to\nearnings point and dat this study was\ndone by edel wise and basically what\nthey said was that if you look at the\n28th Feb date and 29th Feb 2024 so\nroughly and what they have done is that\nthey have compared the PE price to\nearnings ratio right\n26.83 was the p ratio 2 years back in\nthe midcap category and in small cap\nalso you can see that the P was 26 28\nthat's a\nPE expansion there has been an EPS\nexpansion in both midcap and small cap\ncategory in\nfact price of a stock goes up because of\nwhat\none so this is literally what the\nmathematical formula here will be\nbasically what this research report is\nsaying PE expansion small cap and midcap\ncar there has been an earnings growth in\nsmall cap and midcap companies now\nwhenever the stock price goes up due to\nearnings growth that is sustainable\nWhenever there is a p expansion of the\nentire industry entire\nmarket so as of now there is no\nindicator that stuff shortterm\nabsolutely\nyes that's a good opportunity to buy and\ntherefore I am also buying today I wrote\na community post also and again I keep\non encouraging all of you guys to check\nout my YouTube member Community\nrespon say and I would encourage all of\nyou if you are a serious investor\nconsider joining the member Community\nfor 3 months time you yourself will see\na stark difference in the way you invest\nyour own money it will give you a lot of\nrational commentary rational insights so\nfar the experience of people has been\ngreat I'm just putting up some reviews\nso you guys can check it out and\naccordingly you can make a consideration\nof joining it and also the membership\nfee is like really really low so it's\nnot as if I'm charging like crazy amount\nor something so you guys can definitely\ncheck it out so with that said let's\nmove on to the second picture and\ndat so I cannot really comment on how\ntrue this data is at least I checked for\n2024 and 2023 so the data looks reliable\nbut but it looks to be okay but\ndefinitely double check it from your\nside so see basically what this speaks\nabout is the expansion for example 2018\n2017\nperod just small cap 50 it was like you\nknow\n120 you know 28 29 levels so it's not as\nif that there is like massive craziness\nthat has happened last year we were\nbuying small cap midcaps heavily so this\nis a range that we bought so this was a\nvery very good time to buy it but does\nthatan no it is just that issues I don't\nknow why that is being created I hope\nthat this entire situation gets sorted\nout quickly there is no structural\nproblem in small and midcaps now let me\nstart bulleting it out why that is the\ncase but so far I hope that you got the\novervaluation part ke is small cap\nmidcap overv valued undervalued fairly\nvalued you guys make a call I have shown\nyou all the relevant data right so this\nis point one okay so that brings us to\npoint number two that okay then why is\nit that the small cap stocks are falling\nso aggressively okay so there are three\nreasons for that one is that there are\ncompanies or FIS more specifically for\nexample SEL which is one of Singapore's\nbiggest Telecom\ncompany and firms likepool for example\nthey are cutting stake in the Indian\nmarket so\nfi selling is happening in small cap\nmidcap category also and as a result\nthey are losing value now you need to\nask a natural\nquestion a what Quantum of money they\nare selling\ninia and for what reason are they doing\nit\nhow much f are actually selling and you\ncan find this data here and you will see\nthat today in March or March 14 they\nsold\nroughly\n4595 please note that di domestic\ninstitutional\ninvestors these guys are buy if you look\nat monse\ndat\nJanuary inch\nthey are still net so to\nsay January February March right\nand is profit booking opportunity so to\nsay or rebalancing your portfolio\nopportunity for example capital gains in\nIndia you made\nI had bought it not giving good Returns\nwhat should I do so I will book my\nlosses on that stock and move on and I\nwill be able to somewhat offset that\ncapital gains I was supposed to pay this\nis 100% legal many F do it family\nofficers do it big ticket investors do\nit this is 100% legal right\nand right so this is a very Advanced\npoint that I'm trying to teach you now\nthe important point to not\nis all that so please do not worry about\nthat now related point is or a more\npertinent question that you need to ask\nis that okay why are fi selling okay so\nthere are essentially there are many\nreasons why F typically sell one\nis for\nexample\nused so they have categorically said\nthat we are cutting our stake in world\npoool of India to offset that\ndebt and we are trying to settle that\ndebt so this is a legitimate reason no\nproblem second is better investment\nopportunity right and our growth rate\nmight be like 10% on the portfolio if we\npull money out of India start a new\nbusiness maybe we can grow it at 15% so\nthis is called as finding better\nreinvestment opportunity now this is\nsomething that singel is doing okay so\nagain this is a legitimate reason third\npoint is valuation for\nexample about the factos\nsimilarly you have Z who is selling\nmeta selling their own stake in the\ncompany why is that\nbecause and whatnot no I'm not trying to\ndo that think about it interally right\nthese are companies that are setting on\nmassive balance sheet Cas Force already\nB sheet extremely strong debt they don't\nhave to repay any much they one could\nargue have better reinvestment\nopportunities but even those can be\npretty much attained by investing the\nexisting money that they already have so\nthey don't need to cut their stake but\nthey are cutting their stake for\nvaluation\nso now the second key point that you\nneed to understand is regarding profit\nbooking profit booking in the Indian\nmarket short term the small cap midcaps\nlooks heated it made made sense to book\nprofits if you're a short-term investor\nso to say okay so this is definitely\nhappening and especially given the March\nclosing so to\nsay third thing is the structural\nissue why so much Panic has been created\njust a bubble statement right so that\nwas a little bit of a panic situation\nmutual funds have been instructed not to\ntake or many mutual funds have been\ninstructed not to take lumsum in small\ncap midcaps\nif the lump suum is stopped in small cap\nmidcap category so the supply of funds\nis going to shrink right it is going to\ncome down and if the supply of fund to\nsmall cap midcap category goes down then\nresultantly not so much money will be\nable to immediately flow into the stock\nmarket so structural reasons I don't\nknow what why these were created but\ndefinitely panic but it's not a think\nknow that you know mutual funds can only\ntake money in small in sip format no\nit's not going to happen this decision\nmight get reversed in another 2 3 months\nor whenever the bubble so to say settles\nso then comes the natural question I\nhave like four or five key points that\nyou can act upon and tomorrow I'm going\nto write a detailed commentary or\nstarting tomorrow I will start giving\nmore details about the small cap midcap\nInvestments that I'm making I'll give\nyou detailed viewpoint on that this is\nnot a\nrecommendation it will just simply help\nyou understand more and it will give you\none perspective in the market okay so\nhere are a few key things that I will\ntry to highlight number one point please\nstop panicking please stop tracking the\nnews all day it is much better not to\nwatch any news you will become more\nknowledgeable not by watching anything\nrather than watching the news it is just\ncomplete BS okay so please do not keep\ntracking the market all day you have\nbetter use of your time okay so that's\none it will help you avoid Panic for\nmore number two thing if you are sitting\non a loss on small\ncapid so you can consider doing downward\naveraging right now if you are on\nprofits already wait\nconsolidation\nconsolidation right and then you can buy\nit it's okay let the market run up by 5\nmore per or small cap category run up by\n5 more\nper if you say that okay I'm a long-term\ninvestor should I continue my sips 100%\nyes okay markets from a midterm\nlong-term perspective as of now for\nsmall cap category at least to me does\nnot look overvalued I explained you the\nrational again please listen to other\npeople's Viewpoint also and reach your\nown conclusion now let me talk about the\nfundamental thesis as to why the small\ncap midcaps will grow from this stage\nnumber one there will be an interest\nrate\ncut large cap small cap midcaps but as\nthe interest rate get cut whatever the\nnew debt that will be issued it will\nbecome easier for small cap midcaps to\nborrow\nlarge this will Propel the midcap small\ncap category more that's part A Part B\nis that there will be more mergers and\nacquisition activity that will undertake\nin the midcap small cap segment\ninterest settle right after 2 to 3 years\nnow that is where major chunk of m&a\nactivity might pick if the economy seems\nto be okay lot of Dynamics will go into\nthat but to cut the long story short big\nbig companies are going to buy smaller\nmiddle players who survive this termoil\nand I think there have been a bunch of\ngood small cap midcap companies that\nhave been able to survive this turmoil\nso I still feel that small cap midcap\ncategory is going to generate a lot of\nreturns for investors you just need to\nbe sensible which brings me to the final\npoint please pick companies in the small\ncap midcap categories that are growing\ntheir revenues that are in an industry\nthat is growing that has been able to\nhandle its debt really well please do\nnot go by stock\nrecommendations please understand these\nbasic basic points it's going to be\nabsolutely critical\nnow still you want to invest but you're\na little bit scared then the safest\nasset so to\nsay is flexi Gap fund so you can go and\nbuy Flex Gap right\nnow that will grow at a faster rate so\nto say and you know whenever the\ncircumstances are better then I'm sure\nthat mutual fund managers will also\nswitch to a better segment of growth so\non that note now I wanted to discuss\nspecific small cap midcap stocks but\nunfortunately I have run out of time so\nwhat I'm going to do is that I'm going\nto make a part two of this video or I'm\ngoing to start giving commentary from\ntomorrow so with that said I'll close\nout the video I hope you enjoyed it do\npress the like button and I'll see you\nsoon",

Ladakh.\"\nA 21-day fast,\nwhich can become a fast till de@th.\nThink about it, if in any state in our country,\n10% of the population takes to the streets protesting,\nwill it not be a huge news?\nBut the way this news is being\nsuppressed by the news channels,\nit is very shocking to see.\nWe will talk about the demands\nof the protesters later in the video,\nbut, in the video, I would also like to show you\nthat story isn't unique to Ladakh.\nThis story is playing out in\nevery corner of the country today.\nThe political corporate mafia\nthat is putting Ladakh in danger today,\nis the same mafia that\ndestroyed the forests of Hasdeo,\nset fire to the hills of Manipur,\nand is bent on destroying Buxwaha.\nThe same mafia that is causing Joshimath to sink,\nthat caused the tunnel collapse in Uttarkashi,\nand put Lakshadweep in danger.\nIf this mafia is not stopped,\nit will slowly devour the country like a termite.\nIt will make it hollow from within.\nLet's understand this in today's video.\nFriends, if you don't know Sonam Wangchuk,\nthen it is important to tell you that\nhe is the person who inspired\nthe character of Rancho in the film 3 Idiots.\nThe innovations made by Rancho in the film,\nSonam Wangchuk made similar\ninnovations and more in real life.\nIn 2021, he built these environment-friendly\nsolar heated tents for the Indian Army.\nWith these tents, our soldiers\nwere able to stay comfortably\neven in the freezing cold of Ladakh.\nApart from this, Sonam Wangchuk\nhas also designed many carbon\nneutral solar buildings in Ladakh.\nHe was the one to introduce the concept of Ice Stupas.\nTo deal with the water shortage in Ladakh,\nhe introduced this concept\nof building these artificial glaciers.\nThroughout the years, he has been\nawarded many awards for his innovations.\nBe it the Ramon Magsaysay Award,\nthe Green Teacher Award,\nor an award by the UNESCO.\nSo today when this Sonam Wangchuk\nis sitting on an indefinite fast,\nit must be because of a serious problem.\nThe problem is the democracy in Ladakh,\nthe environment of Ladakh,\nand the rights of the people of Ladakh.\nThe people of Ladakh have four main demands.\nFirst, including Ladakh in the\n6th Schedule of the Constitution.\nSecond, giving full statehood to Ladakh.\nThird, electing 2 MPs from Ladakh.\nCurrently, there's only 1 MP\nis from Ladakh in the Lok Sabha,\nand 0 MPs in the Rajya Sabha.\nAnd fourth, establishing a Public Service\nCommission to provide secure jobs in Ladakh.\nLet's understand each of them in detail.\nFirst, what is this 6th Schedule?\nThis is the part of the Constitution\nthat protects the tribal population in the country.\nAccording to this, in tribal areas,\nto promote democracy, the tribal people\ncan form their own Autonomous District Councils\nand Autonomous Regional Councils.\nAlso known as ADCs and ARCs.\nThey are basically elected bodies\nthat have the power to administer tribal areas.\nSo that on a local level, the tribal people\nmake their rules about their land,\nforest, and socio-cultural customs.\nSo that people from outside\ncannot exploit their land and resources.\nToday, this 6th Schedule is applicable\nin the tribal areas of Assam,\nMeghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.\nNow you might think,\nsince there are no forests in Ladakh,\nwhy are the people of Ladakh demanding it?\nThere are three main reasons for this.\nFirst, it is true that there aren't forests in Ladakh,\nbut every area has its natural biodiversity.\nAnd Sonam Wangchuk has explained this many times\nthat the area of Ladakh\nis very vulnerable, considering climate change.\n\"The mountains are facing the wrath of nature\nin the face of climate change.\"\nIf the resources are allowed to be exploited in this area,\nit will be largely dangerous for Ladakh.\nThe frequency of natural disasters,\nflash floods, and landslides will increase.\nSecond, the majority population of Ladakh\nfalls in the Scheduled Tribes category.\nAccording to NCST,\n66.8% of the population of Leh is Scheduled Tribe.\n83% in Kargil,\nand in some areas it is as high as 99%.\nThe third and the biggest reason,\nthe 6th Schedule will give the people\nof Ladakh their democratic rights.\nToday, what do the people of\nLadakh have in terms of democracy?\nThink about it yourself.\nSince the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019,\nLadakh and Jammu and Kashmir were\ndivided into a separate Union Territories.\nPeople didn't have any issues\nwith the abrogation of Article 370,\nrather, their issues are with the actions\nof the government after the abrogation.\nJ&K used to be a full state.\nAfter 2019, it was downgraded\nand divided into two separate Union Territories.\nThis is what J&K's former\nGovernor Satyapal Malik had said.\n\"More than the abrogation of Article 370,\nthey feel bad about this.\"\n\"Absolutely, so why did you do this?\"\n\"I didn't play any part in this.\nHad they asked, I would\nhave warned them against it.\"\nJ&K's Union Territory did get its Legislative Assembly.\nBut Ladakh wasn't given that right.\nBefore 2019, when J&K used to be a full state,\nthere were 4 MLAs from Ladakh.\nBut today, this number has come down to zero.\nDelhi is also a Union Territory,\nbut there exists a state level government.\nYou can vote for them,\nyou can elect them.\nNow, it's a different issue that\nthe Central Government has tried\nits best to take away powers from the Delhi Government,\nover the last few years.\nBut Ladakh wasn't given this right at all.\nThere are no offices at the state level,\nthat you can elect by voting.\nAt the next level,\npeople of Ladakh can vote for the Lok Sabha elections only,\nbut even there,\nthey have been given only 1 MP.\nThis is the reason behind all these demands.\nOn a local level, they want to be included in the 6th Schedule,\nso that they can elect their ADCs and ARCs,\nand can protect their land.\nOn a state level, they want full statehood.\nBut if that isn't possible,\nthey want at least a Legislative Assembly\nso that they can elect their government.\nAnd on a central level,\nthey want to have 2 MPs.\nOtherwise, this is only a shell of democracy?\nFriends, the most interesting thing is that\nit doesn't matter whether\nyou agree with my reasoning or not.\nBecause 4 years ago,\nBJP was the one to demand\nthat Ladakh be included in the 6th Schedule.\nWhat could be the reason\nthat BJP doesn't want to fulfil this demand now?\nIt's an interesting reason\nand quite predictable\nright at the top of BJP's manifesto,\nthey mentioned including Ladakh in the 6th Schedule.\nYou can read what they've\nclearly written in their manifesto.\n\"I have shown this earlier,\ntoday I will show it again,\nin 2019, during the Lok Sabha elections,\nin the third bullet point of you manifesto,\nyou had promised to safeguard\nLadakh in the 6th Schedule.\"\nSeptember 2019 was the first time that\nthe National Commission for\nScheduled Tribes had recommended\nthe inclusion of Ladakh in the 6th Schedule.\nBut the government did not take any action.\nIn August 2020, the people of Ladakh\nput their demands in front\nof the government for the first time.\nIn September 2020,\nthe first mass protest took\nplace in Ladakh regarding this.\nIn 2020, the Autonomous Hill District\nCouncil was to be elected in Ladakh.\nAnd before the elections,\nHome Minister Amit Shah promised that\nwithin 15 days of the election,\nthey would fulfil these demands.\nAfter this, the protests were called off\nand BJP won the elections with 15 seats.\nBut after that, no action was taken.\nDuring December 2021 and November 2022,\nthere were two more protests.\nFor a while, there were discussions with the government\nbut despite writing in on the manifesto,\nthe government kept refusing to give in to their demand.\nThis is the reason for this indefinite fast today.\nIt didn't escalate all of a sudden.\nAs you can see, over the last few years,\npeople have been raising their demands repeatedly.\nBut the biggest question here is,\nWhat is Modi government's problem\nwith fulfilling this demand?\nAdding the people of Ladakh to the 6th Schedule,\nwill not bring the nation crumbling down.\nIt's a simple demand.\nAnd there won't be any backlash for the\nModi government or BJP if they do this.\nAfter all, they were the ones to include this in their manifesto.\nWhat could be the reason behind this refusal?\nI would like you to read a line\nabout the functions of ADCs.\nLook at the screen.\n\"The district and regional councils\nadminister the areas under their jurisdiction.\nThey can make laws on certain specified matters\nlike land, forests, canal water, shifting cultivation...\"\nDid you notice it?\nLands, Forests.\nThis means that if Ladakh is added to the 6th Schedule,\nthen the Modi government won't have power\nover the Ladakh's land.\nThis means that Ladakh's land and forests,\ncannot be sold be PM Modi to his friend.\n\"They wanted every valley here\nto be mined and have industries set up,\nbut Ladakh's people are wary of this.\"\nSonam Wangchuk and Ladakh's people don't want\ntheir lands to be opened up for corporate exploitation.\nDoing this will not mean taking away\nthe rights of the people living there,\nbut it will also be very dangerous\nfor our country's environment.\nLadakh is a beautiful and\necologically sensitive part of our country.\nThe mountains and valleys here are so unique that\nyou can't find such features\nanywhere else in the world.\nThe world's rarest and most\nendangered animal species are found here.\nLike the snow leopards or the Tibetan antelopes.\nThe water of the lakes here is so crystal clear,\nyou won't even believe that\nsuch clarity can be found anywhere.\nAnd if you have ever been to Ladakh,\nthen you must know how innocent\nand pure-hearted these people are.\nTheir culture and tradition,\nthese monasteries and festivals\nare so amazing that\npeople from all over the world come to see them.\nI believe that it is every Indian's duty\nto protect the environment and\ncultural diversity of a place like Ladakh.\nPlaces like these are like precious gems in our country.\nBut the way our government is\ntreating these precious gems today,\ntells you a lot about the government's intention.\nHow long has it been since Manipur is on fire?\nIt's in a state of civil war\nand PM Modi is not willing to even visit that state.\nAnd the reason for Manipur's terrible situation\nis corporate exploitation.\nI explained it in this video.\nThere's deforestation of the Hasdeo jungle in Chhattisgarh.\nPeople made countless reels\nto protect the forest.\nBut the government opened it up for mining.\nWho is benefiting from this?\nThe people?\nOr Prime Minister's friends at the top?\nThis story isn't about Ladakh, Manipur or Hasdeo only.\nOn a large scale, they are trying to\nsell the forests of the country.\nTo sell our mountains,\nand to sell our land.\nAnd the benefit from the corporate exploitation,\ngoes to a select few at the top of hierarchy.\nIf you still can't see the connection,\nclick here to watch this video.\nYou'll understand this funda thoroughly.\nThank you very much!",

    "transcript": "I just want to welcome everyone today\num I my name is Nayeli Gonzalez I am a\nUCS UC San Diego alum I graduated from\nEleanor Roosevelt College in political\nscience with the studies in American\npolitics and from there I loved UC San\nDiego so much that I decided to come\nback and talk to you all today about our\ncollege system and so just today\nwe'll be kind of be covering covering\nover is\nwhat is our agenda\num what is the college system can you\nsee my screen just to double check\ndo you do you see the agenda\nno you do not see the agenda oh no okay\nsorry I've been having issues with my\ncomputer okay let's try this one more\ntime\ngive me one second\n[Music]\nokay\nthis works\nI'm hoping that you can see my screen\nnow\nJesus I really hope you see my screen\nokay\nlet's do screened\nokay awesome so\nwhat\nUCB agenda\nokay perfect all right so just going\nover\num the college system so what is the\ncollege system\num we'll talk about that I'll give you\nadditional resources kind of giving you\nthe overview to each College I will say\nfor UC San Diego this is very unique and\nit's very special programming that we\nhave for our University so we want to\nmake sure that you are well equipped to\nknow how to rank each one of the\ncolleges on the application as well as\njust get a feel to our University and\nthe amount of impact that we make and\nthe intentionality of our programming\nalong with that we're going to kind of\ngo into our College Ventures and then\nlike I mentioned ranking the colleges on\nthe UC application and if you have any\nquestions please feel free to include\nthem in the chat I'm more than happy to\nanswer all of these questions\nnow a little bit about the college\nsystem so this is really unique to our\nUniversity we're the only UC that does\nthis college system and think of the\ncollege system as a neighborhood so our\nUC San Diego is situated on 1200 acres\nof land which is a lot of land for those\nwho've ever been to the happiest place\non Earth which is Disneyland it is about\nseven Disneylands including California\nAdventures so you can tell there's a lot\nof land for those who've ever been to a\nWalmart it's about 480 Walmarts so lots\nof Walmarts and lots of Disneyland\nhow do we make you feel like you're not\njust a number I was coming for myself\nand my experience I was coming from a\nreally small town where I knew everyone\nand I was really scared to just start\ncollege with over 33 000 undergraduate\nstudents and so how do I feel like I am\npart of a community that accepts me that\nis able to take care of me and know each\nother on a one-to-one basis the eight\ncollege system is there for you so we\nfor those who do not know UC San Diego\nis considered a top-tier research\ninstitution so we are known for our\nresearch we are heavy on our research\nbut we also you know because of all this\nprestigiousness that we have here at our\nUniversity we want to still create that\napproachable small community feel like I\nkeep mentioning so that's what we have\nhere at our eighth college system so\neach one of the colleges provides access\nto personal advising Supportive Services\nand opportunities to get involved\nI always like to say that you have eight\ntimes more activities at UC San Diego\nbecause of the eight colleges now when\nyou're ranking them it does not matter\nwhat major you are part of or what major\nyou're interested in every major is\nrepresented in every college so it\ndoesn't matter what it is you can be\npart of any single one of them\nso as someone who went to Eleanor\nRoosevelt College in political science I\nhad friends who were engineers I had\nfriends who were scientists and friends\nwho were business majors so um it is\njust really to create that small unique\nfeel something that's unique for\nfirst-year students so those that are\nthat are coming in straight from high\nschool is that\nyou have your specific general education\nrequirements so we like to say that each\none of our colleges is unique and we\nlove them all equally although we do\nhave a lot of spirit competitions and we\nlike to say which one's always the best\nwhich is usually the one that your your\ncollege is in but it is something that's\nreally fun it keeps the energy going but\nthe only thing that's the difference is\nyour general education requirements and\nyour neighborhood and your location on\ncampus so we're all located almost like\nthose seven Disneylands all located in\none area\nand we have the splits so if you are a\nfirst year coming in you will be living\nwith people in your college taking the\nsame general education as everyone else\nin your college so I remember as a\nstudent coming in remember a small town\ndidn't know anyone I remember entering\nmy first general education class 450\nperson lecture and being like Oh my gosh\nI'm so scared I don't know where I'm\ngonna be I don't know where I'm going\nand then I like look to the side and I\nsee someone who is who's living right\nnext door to me I saw someone from right\ndown the hall and then someone in my\nbuilding and I was like wow my entire\nfriend group is here so it's something\nthat's really nice and really fun\num and a great way to just get involved\nnow going into a little bit more about\nthe resources so if you have any\nquestions at the end of this and you're\nlike you know what I don't know how to I\ndon't I don't know anything else about\nthe colleges you know nially talked\nabout this but still not clicking we\nhave our website\nadmissions.ucsd.edu colleges\nmycompass.ucsd.edu public and\ncompare.ucsd.edu we also have our\nSpanish\nversions for this so you can look at our\nSpanish resources\num they are available to you and so for\ncompare.ucsd.edu the last the last\nbullet point that you see there this is\nfor those that are interested in\nlearning about your four-year plan how\nare you what classes do you have to take\nfor your specific college for your\nspecific major so each one you'll be\nable to click on your major click on a\ncollege Brandon college and then see all\nthe different courses that are listed\nthere if you need more information about\nthe colleges we do have our Triton\nbrochure and that's on our webpage\nadmissions.ucsd.edu Publications\nnow as you see it's a picture of Eleanor\nRoosevelt College my favorite college\nbut\nyou can kind of see the breakdown as to\neach one of the colleges so like I said\nthere are eight colleges we will start\nwith Ravel College which is our first\ncollege John Muir College the Thurgood\nMarshall College Earl Warren College\nEleanor Roosevelt College we have six\nCollege seventh college and eighth\nCollege as you can tell the last three\nhave not been named yet and that's\nbecause we have a specific tradition\nthat happens that we need to wait and\nfind someone who will resemble our\nspecific philosophy so I'm going to\nstart going into them a one by one and\nagain if you have any questions please\nput them on the chat I'm more than happy\nto answer them\nso going into the first college\nRevell college is named after Roger\nRavel who was one of the founding\nmembers of UC San Diego and so he wanted\nto create a university where leaders of\nSciences social sciences Arts and\nHumanities would come together to create\num to create research and groundbreaking\nresearch and so the philosophy with the\nspecific college is where the Sciences\nArts and Humanities joined to educate\nand Inspire multidisciplinary Scholars\nso what this means is that a lot of the\ncourses are going to be looking at your\nHumanities looking at mathematics\nNatural Sciences social sciences Fine\nArts and foreign language and that's\nsomething that I want to mention each\none of our colleges is unique and so the\nge's are going to look a lot different\nso as you start looking and ranking you\nwant to look oh my gosh do I want to\ntake a natural science do I want to take\na heavy Math course those are things\nthat you want to look at for Ravel\nCollege this specific College\nall the classes that you're going to be\ntaking are really just to obtain the\nskills and knowledge to effectively and\ncreatively pursue additional study for\nthose that are in research this is a\ngreat opportunity to you know go beyond\nthe limit you are adapting to a rapidly\nchanging environment and so I like to\nthink of this college as the Renaissance\ncollege or like the Renaissance scholar\nbecause you're taking a little bit of\neverything\nto then become become an educator\nI will be mentioning some of the fun\nactivities and traditions that happen\nthrough each one of the colleges but as\nyou can see you can look down and you'll\nfind all of the Instagram handle on\nthere so you can always check out our\nour posts on there and so I'll mention\neach one of each of this holidays maybe\ntwo if we do have time but one of the\nfun traditions in Revel College\nthat I absolutely love is the watermelon\ndrop\nnow the watermelon drop it's a legend\nthis conspiracy theory that once upon a\ntime there was a professor who gave a\nclass on\nit was like a physics chemistry class\nand the professor made them take a test\nand the students took this test and it\nwas asking if I take a watermelon up to\nYuri Hall which is one of our lecture\nHalls on campus what would be the\nVelocity in which it fell and the\nsplatter radius and so you know students\nare taking this test they're like oh my\ngoodness let's see if we get it right\nand they go to ask the professor\nand they asked the professor can we\nthrow this watermelon is it possible\nand so the professor says\nyeah let's go do it so then go to Yuri\nHall and they go up the stairs because\nthere was no elevator up the stairs\ndropped the watermelon it was like The\nGunshot heard around the world everyone\nknew about this at the end of it they\nsaid oh my goodness the watermelon drop\nand so since then it's been a tradition\nwhere we will Crown our watermelon\nroyalty our watermelon royalty will then\nwalk up the stairs to the watermelon\ndrop the watermelon off it'll splatter\nand then we celebrate with watermelon\nlollipops Watermelon candy\nwatermelon everything and so those are\nfun activities that happen with Ravel\nCollege\nwow right\ngoing on to the next one we have near\nCollege so Muir College is named after\nJohn Muir who was a conservatist as well\nas an environmentalist and so um for\nthose that know a little bit about the\nnational parks you know the Muir Woods\nis is one of those big ones that are in\nNorthern California and so John Muir\nloved the woods loved learning about the\nenvironment and was considered an\nindependent spirit so the philosophy\nwith Muir College is the independent\nspirit\nso you can kind of see the difference\nthe contrast between Ravel College which\nis learning about a little little\neverything to Muir College which is just\nfocused on one person one thing and so\nwe really work on your college to\nprepare to lead a variety of successful\ncommitted and self-directed life so the\nclasses that you'll be taking are a\nlittle bit centered towards liberal arts\ncourses so you're looking at writing\nsocial sciences a math or science course\nand then two of the following three\nareas Fine Arts that you get to choose\nFine Arts Humanities and a foreign\nlanguage so you can choose two of the\nthree\na fun activity that happens I don't know\nwhat it is about people and UC San Diego\nthrowing fruits and veggies around but\nwe have this tradition called The\nPumpkin drop and ironically it happens\nclose to Halloween where we will grab\nthis huge pumpkin that's not like a\nregular watermelon it's a huge pumpkin\nand they will carve the inside of a\npumpkin add candy to it and then they\nwill take it we don't prawn we don't\nCrown pumpkin royalty unfortunately I\nhad already asked a while back I wanted\nto be royalty and it didn't happen but\nthey will take this pumpkin all hands on\ndeck take it to the highest Ella of the\nhighest elevator the highest building of\nnear College and drop it I've never once\nseen\n18 19 22 year olds run for candy it was\nlike it was it was a fruit pinata it was\nthe most fun activity I've ever seen\nhappen where everyone's like running for\ntheir lives to get this candy so that's\na fun activity that happens in Weir\nCollege\nnow um also I do want to highlight one\nof the other activities that happens in\nyour college and that's mere stock your\nstock is a really fun event and you'll\nkind of see each one of the colleges\nwill have a music festival like I said\nif I got to participate in the pumpkin\ndrop I got to see the watermelon drop I\nget to be involved in all the different\nactivities but this isn't one this\nwasn't my college that's okay remember\neight times more activities so you get\nto be part of everything from your stock\nthis is a fun Festival Music Festival if\nyou're interested in photography you\nlike to do event planning you want to\nyou know get connected to people this is\na really good way to get involved\nbecause it is student run so all of my\nfriends got to put in your stock I got\nto drive the artists and the rappers\num from your stock one of the years so\nit's a really fun way to get involved\nand if you're interested in getting to\nsee some of the more more activities\nthat happens in your college you'll see\nit in your college official\nall right on the moving on to the next\none we have Marshall College and\nMarshall College is named after third\nand Marshall who was\num The prominent lawyer in the Bradley\nBoard of Education case which\ndesegregated nation schools and then\nlater was the United States Supreme\nCourt Justice and so with Marshall\nCollege thinking about law thinking\nabout civil rights\nthe college itself is the philosophy is\nthe scholar and citizen so your general\neducation while it is in maths Natural\nSciences Fine Arts Humanities and areas\noutside your major this is really\nlooking at the Deep analysis of the\nchallenges that people have faced in the\nUnited States looking at the\ncontradictions as to how it shaped the\ninstitutions social justice movements\nand being able to create and give\nstudents the necessary skills to\nchallenge injustices as they arrive in\nthe United States and in the world so\nsome of the Traditions that are really\nfun in this um this specific College are\nis Marshall palooza and for those that\ndon't know I did mention I was part of a\nsmall town I like to consider it a cow\ntown where I would have fairs every year\nand so I started to miss it towards the\nSpring quarter I started missing you\nknow seeing all my friends go to their\nfairs back home that Marshall palooza\nwas right in the middle\num I got both music and I got my little\nfare so they had a ferris wheel a photo\nbooth they had um what a petting zoo so\nyou could pet animals it was a really\nfun event that you can get involved in\nso that's something that's really really\ncool they also have a lot of cultural\ncelebrations that happen in Marshall\nCollege\num doesn't matter what you know what\nidentities you identify with you could\nbe part of these cultural celebrations\nto gain awareness which is really cool\nthe next college is Earl Warren College\nand so Earl Warren was named after the\nthree-time California governor and the\nChief Justice of the United States\nSupreme Court Earl Warren and um the\nspeaking of Chief Justice of the United\nStates Supreme Court he did preside over\nthe brown B Board of Education case\nwhich I mentioned in the last slide and\nso because he was so involved in a lot\nof different things people always\nwondered you know how does this person\nlive a life imbalance and so Earl Warren\nCollege the philosophy there is towards\na life imbalance so it is understanding\nthe important contributions an\nindividual can make in a society so the\ngeneral education will resemble too many\nminors so you get to choose outside of\nyour major two smaller area studies that\nyou want to do\num which is kind of cool because then\nyou get to decide what you want to\nchoose and then from there create your\ngeneral education a fun tradition that\nhappens in Earl Warren College is\nWarren's Got Talent again anyone can\nparticipate Got Talent you get to be\npart of Warren's Got Talent so you get\nto show off your talents there's also\nWarren live concert\num where Jesse McCartney not too sure if\nyou all know who that is at the time\nwhen I was younger I\nhe was awesome\num Lauren live super fun event they\nalways have cool on awesome people come\nin and perform for them\nand then winter at Warren land is a fun\nactivity where they will bring\num I think they're they're like Machines\nof like fake snow and so people will go\nslow like sledding and we'll have um\nwe'll also have like snow eye like you\ncan do like ice snows or like snow\nangels it's really fun a really cool\nactivity to do\nall right and so the next one is\nnow it's Eleanor Roosevelt college and\nthis is my favorite college because I\nwent to this college uh for those who\ndon't know who Eleanor Roosevelt was she\nis the former first lady at the United\nStates but was actually the first United\nStates delegate to the United Nations\nand so the philosophy here is developing\nWorld citizens through scholarship\nleadership and service I always like to\nsay the international scholar so\nwhatever your field of study is you get\nto explore your interest and\nresponsibilities as a global citizen so\nthe core courses that you'll be taking\nfor the specific College are really\nfocused on International understanding\nand cultural diversity so you'll be\ntaking a language class\nyou'll be taking\num some sort of anthropology sociology\ncourse which is a which is really\nawesome so I definitely felt that\nInternational scholar by the end of my\ntime at Eleanor Roosevelt College a fun\ntradition that happens is Sunday suppers\nat international house so the\nInternational House is just that it's\ncalled ihouse International house it's\n50 American students and 50\nInternational students and so this is a\ngreat opportunity for those that want to\nget involved every cent not every Sunday\nonce Sunday one Sunday a month they will\nhost a a specific country the host is\nspecific culture and students will put\nthis on and you get to eat that specific\nfood from the culture they'll have music\nthey'll have students get involved so\nyou kind of get to learn a little bit\nmore about different cultures gain\nawareness gain awareness of certain\nissues that are happening in those\ncultures or those Nations and so that's\na good way to get involved in that\nokay and as I said we're gonna start\ncontinuing on after Eleanor Roosevelt\nCollege we start getting into the sixth\nseventh and eighth College they haven't\nbeen named yet just because like I said\nwe really focus in on who who is the\nperson that embodies this specific\npersonality are the specific specific\nPhilosophy for this college so sixth\nCollege was opened in 2001 and so the\nidea there is innovative interconnected\nand aware so it's cultivating curious\nminds to tackle the complex challenges\nof our time so this is moving towards\nyou know we're going from 2001 now\nhitting 2022 we're looking at\nstudents who are in sixth College\ngraduating with the ability to engage\neach other the world to find ways to\ntackle complex challenges to find the\nnecessary tools to build a more\nsustainable and Equitable future for all\nso the the big course that happens here\nis\num cat which is really a critical\ninquiry into how art and Technology\nshape and Propel cultures so like I said\nit really just engaged that like\nInnovative which is the the art and\nTechnology interconnected which would be\nyour cultures and being aware of all how\nthat all comes together a fun tradition\nthat happens here and as you know we're\nhitting dinner time so I'm starting to\nget a little hungry but the Chocolate\nFestival is the most amazing activity\nthat happens here I got involved my\nfirst time I couldn't I didn't know that\npeople would dunk mac and cheese into\nchocolate fountains it's a thing I don't\nknow why but um The Chocolate Festival\nis a fun activity that you you go in\nthey have chocolate everything you can\ngo multiple times to the chocolate\nfountain you can dunk Rice Krispies you\ncan jump strawberries hamburgers if you\nwant to\num it's a really fun activity that you\nget to be involved in um while you're in\nsix college or while you're in any other\ncollege and again if you are interested\nin getting to see more of the activities\nmore of the students you can always go\non to our Instagram page and see that\nnow going into our seventh College our\nseventh college is I'm just gonna double\ncheck on time but our seventh college is\none of our newer colleges and the\nphilosophy there is confronting the\nconfronting the challenges of a changing\nPlanet so now we're really focusing in\non what's what's occurring in our in our\ncurrent Society in our planet and how is\nthat affecting us so when it comes to\nour students\nwe're really looking at\nempowering students with the knowledge\nand the necessary skills to confront the\nchallenges posed by our changing planet\nand so you'll be seeing the a lot of the\ncourses look at enhancing their academic\nexperience through research internships\nand studying abroad and this is really\nagain the challenges of a changing\nPlanet we're looking at it from every\nfield so it doesn't matter whether\nyou're stem because I know we think a\nlot when it comes to changing Planet as\na stem thing no if this is into politics\ninto education how can we create\nSolutions in every field towards this\nchallenge of a changing planet and\nthat's something that I do want to\nhighlight\na fun activity here\num is the sunset Soiree that happens\neveryone gets together and um just like\nit's a festival of just being excited\nfor the school year we also have Earth\nweek and every like it's an entire week\nobviously Festival\num but they have different activities\nand programming that occurs during that\ntime\neighth college is our engagement in\ncommunity\nand so\num as you can see it's kind of it looks\nkind of bland right now but that's\nbecause if you are a rolling as a fall\n2023 student you may be the first class\nwhich is really exciting so the\nphilosophy with eighth college for those\nthat are interested it's engagement in\ncommunity so it's looking at into this\ninterdisciplinary approaches to solving\nissues within our community so you know\nwe looked at International we looked\nacross across different fields this is\nreally focusing in on community so we're\nlooking at addressing some of the\nworld's most challenging issues that are\nstructural racism economic disparities\nhealth and well-being because you know\nwe see that happening a lot more um and\nmore current here in in this time being\nmore aware of our health and well-being\nwe're looking at climate disruption and\na lot more things that are happening so\nif you are interested you know you can\nbe part of this and as you can see there\nare no Traditions so if you're someone\nwho's like I want to leave a legacy I\nwant to be the first person to create a\ntradition for AIDS College this is your\ntime to shine and you get to be part of\nthat experience\nall right going on to the next thing um\nthe joint ventures and we're almost done\nthe joint ventures these are for people\nwho are identified with the certain\nCommunity\num certain identity if we do have the\nAfrican black diaspora LLC which is our\nliving Learning Community these are\ncommunities that you get to be a part of\nyou do have to apply\nit's the application's not very\ndifficult but you get to apply and then\nyou'll be living with Community within\nthat community so that Community can be\ncompletely different from your college\nand that's something that I do want to\nknow\num each one is located in different\nareas but if you are really interested\nin you know growing and you're like I\nwant to be closer to my like so the\npeople that I identify with then from\nthere you can definitely be part of the\nliving writing communities so we do have\nthe African black diaspora as I\nmentioned we have the lgbtqia plus\nliving learning community and the rasa\nresource uh Russell resource the rasa\nliving learning community and those are\nfor our latinx chicanex students\num we also have our Sprite and research\nand it's experimental learning\nscholarship program that you get to that\nyou can get part and be in part you can\nget to be involved and if you're\ninterested we do have our first year in\ntransfer year experience courses and you\ncan take that one course and get to it\nhelps you transition which is a really\nnice opportunity and as I mentioned\nbefore we are so competitive we're we\nalways when it comes to our colleges\nwill get so excited and pepped up to\njust show our experience show which\ncollege is the best college so the on\nOlympics is a great opportunity where\nyou can be part of a dance competition\nyou could be part of an obstacle course\nor just root on and you know show\nposters for your specific College\num the last thing that I do want to\nmention is the Craft Center\nopen house in the Craft Center open\nhouse actually it's located in sixth\ncollege and you get as a student you\nhave access to the Craft Center I had\naccess to the Craft Center\num even as a as an admissions officer\nand I got to create an art piece with\nall of my friends which was really fun\nokay so now going into the\nnitty-gritties now when you're applying\nto UC San Diego you're going to click\nthat box that says UC San Diego it's\ngoing to open up a college system\nranking you get to rank it based on\npreference\nI always say as a student as a family\nmember as an admissions officer look at\nyour general education requirements as\nyou can see each one is different each\none is unique so look over this Warrior\nplan see you know if you're not someone\nwho wants to take an entire chemistry\nsequence maybe a specific College might\nnot be the one that you want to rank to\nthe top you want to look at the college\ntheme the College culture but I will say\nthat ranking does not affect your\nchances of admissions or Majors we will\nadmit you first as you as an individual\nwith no say in terms of major we will\nthen place you into your major and will\nplace you into your college and so\nthat's something to consider for our\nadmissions and like I said our college\nsystem is unique so you need to take\nthat into consideration\nand of course if you have any other\nquestions when it comes to the UC San\nDiego college system you can learn more\nabout it at the website provided down\nbelow\nnow I know we have a couple of minutes\ndo anyone have any does anyone have any\nquestions\nI do have a few questions that are in\nthe chat that I'll relate to\nperfect\nthe first question is what is the\ndistinction between the eight colleges\nare there more majors\nwhat's the distinguishion between eight\ncolleges it's just a it's just that\nneighborhood feel it's the philosophy\nthe general education\num they don't have every major is\nrepresented throughout every single one\nof the colleges so that's completely\nseparated from your academic schools so\nit doesn't matter what major you're in\nyou can go into any single one of them\nwe'll you'll still get access to all the\ndifferent Majors on our campus\nthe second question is for admission\npurposes do they consider weighted GPA\nyes for admission purposes we do\nconsider weighted GP and we look at your\n10th and 11th grade year\nand then would it be more helpful to\ntake more honor and AP courses\num if someone likes to take challenging\ncourses but doesn't always\nhave the have an A would it be better to\ntake a c College Prep course and get a\nname\nyeah that's a great question um so we\nlook at you or we look at the applicant\nthrough the local school context so\nwe'll be comparing your student to your\npeers and so that's something to take\ninto consideration we do want to make\nsure that our students we look at a 13\npoint scale and you can look that up on\nour website we do have all the bullet\npoints with everything that we look at\num for us we look at you and this is\nunique to UC San Diego it's a holistic\napproach so we want to know that your\nstudent is rigorous and is taking\nrigorous coursework so\num while it is helpful and obviously any\nAP honor courses is always considered a\nplus for us\num it's not a necessary thing but it is\nfor it is considered one of those\nrigorous courses we want to see you in\nthe context of your school\num and then\nyeah I think I think that answers your\nquestion yep and then\num another question\ncan you explain a little bit about the\ndifferent colleges do they apply\nseparately or is it just the ranking\nsystem\nthat you don't have to\num you don't have to\napply you'll just be ranking them and so\nwe usually choose your top three choices\num and lately we've not lately but this\npast year we did really well and we were\nplacing it within the top two which is\ngood so make sure that you're looking\nbecause um it's up to you you get to\ndecide it has a lot to do with how you\nrank them\nif you want a major in engineering or\nall those majors in Warren no Tyler not\nall those majors are in Warren I know\nthat's a misconception you can be part\nof any single one of the majors um it\ndoesn't necessarily\nsome students do that aren't in\nengineering are in Warren College it'll\nreally just be based on what your\nphilosophy is and how you want to take\nclasses I had friends who are engineers\nand biochemists\num and Eleanor Roosevelt college and\nthey did exceptionally well like\nreceived Awards and like 4.0 GPA\nthroughout um college and they were in a\nvery heavy social sciences so really it\ngoes it depends on what kind of classes\nyou want to take so\num that's something to consider\nfollow up to that how do you rank the\ncolleges for the engineering majors yeah\nlook I would say go to the the uh\nspecific website for the four-year plans\nand look at the classes that you'll have\nto take of course there's some courses\nespecially when it comes to your GES it\nbeing like the chemistry sequence\nphysics sequence\num this might be something to take into\nconsideration because you know you could\ncancel or eliminate\num certain courses for both your GES and\nyour major courses so that's something\nto take into consideration so I say look\nat the website look through all of the\ndifferent and there's a PDF to all the\nway on the bottom of our page that will\ngive you the entire breakdown but I\nwould say look at those four year plans\nas well\num do you look at the 9th and 12th grade\ngrades for GPA for admissions yeah so\nwhile we take into consideration your\n10th and 11th grade\nwe are like we we look at your GPA for\n10th and 11th grade but we do take into\nthe consideration your 9th and 12th\ngrade year so we want to make sure that\nyou're still being rigorous that you if\nyou had any dips or declines let's say\nninth grade you're going to do really\nwell\num you can always include it in the\nadditional comment section that's\nsomething that I always recommend\num and just kind of talk about your the\nsituation that happened you know that\ncould have been a really difficult time\nand transition so you want to include\nthat but yes we do look at how rigorous\nyou were\num your 12th grade as well\nor is it possible to transfer among the\neight colleges throughout your time at\nUCSD yeah great question\num so for the most part you can transfer\nthroughout or among those eight colleges\nhowever on your first year or as a\ntransfer student they'll recommend that\nyou stay in your specific college for an\nentire year before applying to transfer\na lot of the students that apply to\ntransfer they're only applying to\ntransfer because they realize that they\ncould graduate earlier at a different\ncollege and so\num that's why the ranking it is really\nimportant because if you you see you you\nknow you could possibly graduate in a\nmuch earlier time if that's something\nthat you're looking at and so they'll\nhave you wait an entire year and then\nafter that that's when you get to apply\nbut remember think of it as a community\nyou're already within your community\nyou're taking all the classes with\npeople that you know already for a lot\nof people they end up not transferring\nand they don't end up not applying to\ntransfer because they've already made\nall their friends at that College\nand two more questions um if a student\nis taking courses through dual\nenrollment at a local community college\nwhile in high school would it be in\ntheir favor to do so\num just because it impacts the amount of\nGES they will take later\nyeah great question\num\nso yeah students can you know you have\nthe opportunity to do a role\num you if you are able and you have the\nresources to take communion college\ncourses to get them exempt I always\nrecommend to check assist and you can\nalways check with your community college\ncounselor assist is a great way to see\nif that's transferable\num not all classes at a community\ncollege are transferred or considered UC\ntransferable so as long as your student\nis taking courses that are UC\ntransferable they'll be able to receive\ncredit and you know you could also\ninclude that on your application in\nterms of the college coursework you can\ninclude that you've been that your\nstudents been taking or your student\nwill be saying that they've been taking\nthose classes\nis there a health care option as a major\nand which college is that in\nis there a health care major we have\nover 140 Majors minors in areas of\nconcentration we have a list on our\nwebsite\num we do have public health which is a\ngood one if you're interested in\nbecoming a health major that's uh and we\ndo have specializations for that public\nhealth I believe so so I would say check\nour website and look at the 140. it's a\nlot they go there's a lot of information\num but there's no specific college for\nthat specific major so remember the\ncollege system is just your\nneighborhoods it's each it's almost like\neight Disneylands think of them as\ndifferent worlds and they do not align\nfor those that are that know about Harry\nPotter or our huge Harry Potter fans\nthink of them just like the schools\num where you know you're all eating\ntogether but you all have their\ndifferent schools so that's something to\ntake in mind\nokay and then um are you taking classes\nwith this with similar people within\nyour college you talked about community\nand so you can just yeah so the ge's for\nthe most part you'll be taking obviously\nyou're not going to be taking it with\nall a thousand students within your\ncollege but you'll be taking with people\nthe general education with people in\nyour college so um the writing sequences\nfor some of those courses are just for\npeople in that college so yes there are\ngoing to be some classes where you'll be\ntaking them with the same people I think\nI started noticing that some of the\nclasses that I was taking for my GES and\nmy college\num I noticed people from those from\nthose classes in my political science\ncourses and in other courses that I\nentered so you'll start seeing similar\npeople but um that doesn't mean that you\ncan't make more friends out of the\ncolleges because you do you will be\ntaking other courses it's not just going\nto be like a high school class where\nyou're just taking classes with that\nspecific group\nokay thank you so much snaily\num we really appreciate you taking the\ntime to meet with us this evening thank\nyou all for attending this session just\na reminder these sessions will be\navailable\num the recordings will be available\nshortly after the event\nhave a great evening everyone",

    "transcript": "all right people if you're someone who\ndreams of working in the silicon valley\nor driving down hollywood or living the\nhustle life of california or basically\njust like me someone who likes to play\ngta this video is for you we are going\nto break down everything you need to\nknow for the ucs or the university of\ncalifornia all of them the admission\nprocess and what kind of scholarships\nthey provide to undergrad and graduate\ninternational students\n[Music]\nso right off the bat depending on what\ntype of research each of the university\nof california provides they are divided\ninto 10 different colleges and obviously\nyou know they're spread out in the state\nof california itself so ucs are super\npopular and if you kind of look at the\nstats for the last few years you can see\nthat they roughly admitted anywhere\nbetween 17 to 19 000 international\nstudents and i think that's a pretty\ngood diverse ratio considering that\nthere are so many students that apply to\nall of the ucs domestic and\ninternational so let's talk about some\ninteresting facts because you know i\nlove telling you guys these really cool\nthings that i find when i\ndo my research for these videos um in\nterms of like the biggest uc that\nenrolls the most number of students it's\nucla and ucla enrolled 31 000\nundergraduate students last year and in\nterms of the smallest uc which is also\nthe newest of like the gang um it's uc\nmerced that enrolled just 7000 undergrad\nstudents and just like a fun fact for\nyou guys when i was applying for my\nmaster's\nthere were some programs that i applied\nfor a phd because at that time it was\nrelatively new that you know you could\nskip masters and from your bachelor's\nyou could directly go to a phd i\nactually got accepted by uc merced they\ngave me a full ride and a pretty good\nstipend but i ended up turning down\ntheir offer to go to cornell instead so\ni know that it gets a little confusing\nbecause collectively all of them are\nknown as the uc's but they are actually\nindividual colleges so they have one\nportal which is the university of\ncalifornia application portal that you\nuse to apply to all of the uc's but you\nhave to select each individual college\nthat you want to apply to now out of all\nof them they're not equal in terms of\nlike acceptance rate and other like\nmerit based criteria and just for\nexample the two most competitive ucs are\nucla that has an 8.6 acceptance rate and\nuc berkeley that has an 11.4 acceptance\nrate with both of these acceptance rates\nthe ucs also mentioned things like\nminimum gpa requirements and just rough\nnumbers so that a student who's applying\ncan get\nan idea of somewhat of like what the\nprofile should look like and how he or\nshe would compare to other students that\nare also applying now the fee structure\nis a little complicated because when you\nopen the website to look at the cost of\nattendance they have it segregated into\nthree parts in-state out-of-state and\nthen international and just so it's\nclear any student that's coming as an\ninternational student the international\nfee will apply to you for all four years\nand roughly your tuition fee will be\naround like forty six thousand dollars\nseven thousand dollars in books supplies\nand insurance and roughly seventeen to\ntwenty thousand dollars in living\nexpenses for my master's and phd\nstudents you can expect a tuition fee of\nupwards of 28 000\nand this can vary from department to\ndepartment so you'll need to go into the\nspecific area of interest that you're\nlooking for and see what the fee\nstructure is over there so listening to\nthese numbers you guys must be thinking\nthat the ucs must be providing some sort\nof aid right like right\num but unfortunately i have some pretty\nbad news for you guys uh i looked a lot\nand when i say a lot i really dig down\ninto those like sub pages on literally\nall of the nine or ten ucs that are\navailable and what i ultimately found\nwas that there is minimal scholarships\ngiven to international students directly\nfrom the college itself and the little\nbit of scholarship that they do provide\nis in the form of merit-based\nscholarship but apart from that there is\nno need based scholarship for\ninternational students so css profile\nnope and what they actually suggest\ninternational students do is actually\nfind external sources of funding and\ni'll put some examples of those on the\nscreen right now before you close this\nvideo because i said there are no\nscholarships there is a trade-off and a\nbig reason why students come to study\nthe university of california it's in the\nsilicon valley and there are so many job\nopportunities surrounded by companies\nlike google amazon meta and others but\nbasically it provides a good environment\nfor you to do co-ops and potential\ninternships and ultimately even find a\nreally high paying job the data suggests\nthat on average after you graduate you\ncan expect to earn anywhere between 100\nto 150 000 as a bachelor student and\nthat is good enough to cope up and even\nrepay any loans that you potentially\nhave as a master's student you can\nexpect to earn anywhere between 150 to\n200 000\nand i also saw some salaries that ranged\nupwards of 200 000\nnow because california in general is\nknown as the silicon valley there's so\nmany startups as well as well\nestablished companies there is a wide\nvariety of opportunities and that's what\nmakes the uc's the prime spot for\nstudents to come and complete their\neducation now unlike most colleges in\nthe us applying to the ucs can be a\nlittle confusing because they have their\nown separate application they don't use\ncommon app or coalition they have a uc\nportal where you can apply to all of the\nnine ucs and the reason why you have to\napply to all of the colleges separately\nis because you need to first understand\nwhich colleges offer the major that you\nwant and then select that and add it\ninto the portal now the portal is very\ninteractive and honestly it was fun to\nkind of like scroll around the uc map to\nsee how all of the nine ucs are spread\nout the ucs have pretty strict minimum\nacademic requirements and what i mean by\nthis is on their website they clearly\nstate that in your high school you have\nto complete a certain set of subjects\nbefore you can even qualify to apply now\nthese subjects basically include things\nlike history language science um some\nsort of like math one math two\nand if you kind of like select your\ncountry you can scroll down and look at\nthe minimum marks that you would require\nin your 12th board exam to satisfy their\nminimum criteria now if you scroll down\nto india for example you can see that\nyou need to have a minimum of 70 percent\nand no subject score should be less than\n60\nso it's not like that high of a\nrequirement but they do have these\nspecific guidelines so let's take a look\nat all the documents and things that\nthey require for your undergrad\napplication the first thing on the list\nis transcripts now i know that in common\napp everyone is used to submitting 9 to\n12 but ucs go a step further and they\nask you to submit your marks all the way\nfrom grade 7 to 12. like that is\nexaggerating a bit but i guess they want\nto have like a thorough academic history\nof the student um so yeah be prepared to\nhave like report cards and mark sheets\nof like all of those grades now you\ndon't have to send in these transcripts\njust yet all of these are self-reported\nwhich means that on the portal you just\nhave to fill out the grades that you got\nand\nthe sending the transcript part only\ncomes into the picture if you're\nadmitted number two on the list are test\nscores now the ucs make it very clear\nthat if you give the sat or act they\nwill not consider it in their decision\nto admit you so if you have a good score\nyou can definitely submit it but it's\nnot going to affect your application in\nany way in my opinion i feel like that\nis a good thing it allows the college to\nlook at your overall profile rather than\njust one competitive exam score so it\ngives you know all the students like\nbetter chances of being able to express\nthemselves number three on the list is\nthe annual income now this is an\noptional section where you can add your\nparents income but remember that for\ninternational students the uc's don't\nprovide need-based financial aid so just\nin my opinion i feel like this is really\nnot necessary for international students\nespecially because\nthe ucs are need aware universities when\nit comes to international students so\nbecause adding those financial details\nisn't going to get you any aid it's prob\nyou're probably better off just avoiding\nthat section altogether number four on\nour list is activities and honestly this\nwas my favorite section when i was going\nthrough all of uh the bullet points here\nbecause the uc's allow you to add up to\n20 activities and you can choose from\nlike different categories that they have\nthere is honors there's extracurricular\nactivities awards educational\nexperiences coursework volunteering and\neven work experience and unlike common\napp that just gives you like 150\ncharacters which is one sentence to\nexplain an entire activity the uc's\nactually provide 350 characters which\nsum up to like a couple sentences to\nexplain what you did and i'm going to\ngive you guys a little tip on how you\nshould best use this space now let's say\ni'm a high school student and i was the\ncaptain of the school basketball team\nnow one way i could write this is i\ncould name the activity as sports\ncaptain and i could write that i created\nteam tactics and played inter-school\nmatches now there's nothing wrong with\nthis you know i could definitely write\nmore but i'm providing all the\ninformation that they've asked for\nnow another way i could write this is i\ncould name the activity sports captain\nhyphen women's basketball team at\nbethany high which provides more\ninformation right in the title of what i\nwas the sport that i did and the school\nand then just and in the description i\ncan write something like organized and\nran bi-weekly team meetings for strategy\nset up\nteam training sessions with the coach\nbrainstormed and created group\nactivities to improve teamwork and\nupdated team members through monthly\nnewsletters participated and won five\ninter-school basketball tournaments\nnow when you actually like compare both\nof these side by side it's the exact\nsame activity and there's no right or\nwrong between both of them they're both\nperfectly fine but it's about how\nprecisely you're able to express what\nyou did what your roles and\nresponsibilities were\nhow you contributed and if there were\nany challenges or new things you brought\nto the table so the more information you\ncan provide in this section the better\noff you'll be now you guys didn't think\nthat the list was over right i mean we\nhaven't tackled the biggest part essays\nbut wait the uc's don't call them essays\nthey're called personal insight\nquestions\ndon't ask me why but basically on the\nportal itself they give you the option\nof eight personal insight questions and\nyou have to pick and answer any four of\nthem now the word limit for these\nquestions is anywhere between 250 to 350\nwords so about like half a page worth of\nanswer which is not bad at all so you're\nnot writing like pages worth of essays\nbut these are like really creative\nquestions for example they they may ask\nyou about leadership\nsome place where you were creative a\nchallenge that you were able to solve or\nan ability or talent that you like to\nshowcase now these are just examples but\nall eight questions that you guys see\nyou have to pick any for and write about\nthat and if you guys need like final\ntouches from ivy league pros um someone\nwho's actually done gone through the\nprocess you guys can check out the essay\nreviews at incognito blueprints.com now\nthe next section that i want to talk\nabout is the additional information\nsection and it's a pretty small section\num it's not too relevant and it's\noptional but the reason i bring it up is\na lot of students you know asked me that\nthey didn't do so well in grade eight or\nthey had a personal issue because of\nwhich they didn't do great in a subject\nor in grade nine they failed and how\nwould this impact their overall\napplication now this additional\ninformation section is a chance for you\nto explain these type of situations so\nyou can actually tell the admissions\ncommittee if you had a setback or a\nfailure or something going on in your\npersonal life you can give reasoning\nbehind that and then show the positive\nthat you did you know come out of it and\nyou were able to improve after that so\nthis is your space to tell them anything\nthat you need to\nthat you haven't already the last part\nare the letters of recommendation and i\nhave great news for you guys ucs don't\nrequire any lors um after they give you\nthe admission they may ask for a\nreference which is also a maybe when\nyou're submitting your application you\ndon't need to submit any letters of\nrecommendation the applications for fall\n2023 have already opened so you guys can\ncreate your uc portal online for free\nand you could submit your applications\nanytime from october 1st to november\n30th so until now we've covered\neverything you need to know if you're\napplying as an undergrad student to the\nucs so coming to my graduate students\nmasters and phds\nyou guys won't be applying through the\ncommon uc portal each one of the uc\nuniversities has its own individual\nportal that you can apply to so my step\none would be to browse through you know\nall nine or ten universities and see\nwhich one actually has the research lab\nor the area that you're interested in\npursuing your graduate education and\nthen you can go to their portal and\napply now in terms of the requirements\nthey'll pretty much stay the same as the\nundergrad requirements and in addition\nto that since you guys are applying for\na grad degree you also need to submit\nyour undergrad transcripts so coming to\nthe aid for graduate students now i want\nto kind of divide this into two parts\nthere's a couple programs that don't\nhave any aid for example the masters of\nengineering programs but the advantage\nto these programs is that it's a\none-year course it's basically the same\nprogram that i did at cornell they don't\noffer any outright aid when you enroll\nbut since you're able to finish the\nprogram in one year you can immediately\nstart working in an industry of your\narea immediately after that so you're\neligible to get your opt and stem work\nauthorization and you know it's a really\nfast degree but on the other hand\nresearch based masters or phds have\nstipends uh they may you know have you\nwork as a ta or ra to earn your monthly\nlike amount and cover up your tuition\nfee so that's pretty common among all\nu.s colleges and uc is included all\nright guys so that's all that i had for\nthis video and if you guys are watching\ntill this point like a big thank you i\nknow that this video got a little long\nbut there was just so much information i\nwanted to like get put out there the\nprocess is a little different for the\nucs um but i hope that you know this\nvideo made it easier for you guys to\nunderstand uh the road to success series\nhas been going great if we can get this\nvideo to 500 likes i would like\nliterally love you guys um but today's\nquestion that i have for you guys is\nwhat sport do you like to watch on tv\nand who is your goat mine is hold on\nwait\ni'm going to show you\nsteph curry so this is the only jersey\nof any player that i have and i got this\nin like 2015\num i think i got it in boston actually\ni've seen him play once live um it was\nuh the cleveland versus golden state\nwarriors game in cleveland but i it's\nkind of like my all-time dream to watch\nhim play um in his home court i feel\nlike that vibe in general would be just\nsomething that i'd like to experience at\nleast once so let me know yours in the\ncomments below um like the video\nsubscribe if you haven't already and i\nwill see you guys tomorrow bye\n[Music]\n[Music]",

    "transcript": "[Music]\nwhat is up Triton's michael coming at\nyou back keep saying that wrong coming\nback to you with another video now you\nmay have noticed I switched the channel\nname from Mars daughter to Michael and\nmy QL nothing has really changed I just\nfelt like I liked the name Michael a\nlittle bit more than Mars daughter Mars\ndaughter was like a permutation slash\nconjunction of my last name and uh I\nsort of liked in the beginning but you\nknow as I started doing YouTube a little\nbit more I'm leaning more towards\nMichael so if you look at my other\nvideos the intro is gonna be the same\nit's gonna say Mars odd or I'll probably\nintroduce myself as Mars daughter\neverything's the same except I'm just\ngonna be going for Michael now and my QL\nbecause there's too many other Michaels\non YouTube I've just spell it in a very\nfun way but yeah so that was just a\nquick announcement nothing's changed\njust more of a name change but to get\ninto the juicy meat and potatoes of this\nvideo if you haven't seen my hue in my\nvideo check that bad boy out right here\nWaypoint right right there I am going\ninto be I'm going to be a senior at the\nUniversity of California San Diego and\nI'm gonna answer some questions about\nwhat does it actually like studying so\nI'm studying math and computer science\nwith a minor in entrepreneurship and\ninnovation again all stated in my who am\ni videos but to address the elephant in\nthe video is UC San Diego actually\nsocially dead now quick answer is I\ndon't think it is now I'm going off I\ndon't really have a lot of comparison\nbecause you know I only go to one\nUniversity but from what people have\nsaid they have been to multiple\nuniversities and they have said that\nUCSD is more fun so I had a friend who\njust transferred to Berkeley and he says\nUCSD is actually more fun now you\nactually have to the difference between\nyou know other universities I don't need\nto say normal the difference between\nother universities and UCSD is the fact\nthat other universities you may not have\nto go out of your way to find the fun\nbut at UCSD you kind of do so whether\nthat's joining Greek life joining us on\ncampus student organizations going out\nof your comfort zone to meet people from\nother colleges I'll mention the college\nsystem in a bit and I'm a math and Comp\nSci major so I fully get immersed in\nthat like social awkwardness culture\nbecause once people go into that CS\ndungeon there there ain't no talking in\nthere no - one thing I do notice I used\nto be a Steve mmm sorry just a some\nreally hot broccoli one thing I do\nnotice that UCSD is that there seems to\nbe sort of like a negative opinion among\nstudents they're like oh I didn't get\nany UCLA oh I didn't get any UC Berkeley\ndidn't get in a Stanford\nthere's like this weird like just pity\nparty going on a little bit where people\nare just complaining that they didn't\nget into one University you know you\ncan't go in with that mindset otherwise\nyou're just gonna be bummed all the time\nI was bummed I didn't get into UCLA yeah\nI was really bummed but I was also\nreally grateful I got in the UCSD cuz\nUCSD is a great school so you know if\nyou're going to UCSD you might encounter\nsome people that are just real Debbie\ndowners so either just don't hang out\nwith those people or you know try not to\nget affected by them you know and\noverall I think UCSD actually has pretty\ngood programs if you look into their\ncognitive science department the CS\nDepartment a lot of these STEM fields\nUCSD is really really well respected in\nthose communities so if you're going for\nstem UCSD is a great choice if you're\ngoing for arts you know maybe consider\nsomething else cuz you see it's not\nreally known for arts so to touch on the\nsix College System a little bit there's\nsix colleges throughout UCSD and they're\nkind of like the houses of Hogwarts each\nCollege each College has a specific\norientation this has a specific goal in\nmind specific general education\nrequirements stuff like that so I was in\nRoosevelt College Eleanor Roosevelt\nCollege and that was really focused on\nbecoming a global scholar so basically\nthe GE requirements where I did take you\nknow\nlanguage I had to take history in a\ncertain region you know I had to take\nsome making of the modern world classes\nwriting classes so things are really\nfocused on global history and things\nlike that becoming a world sis and where\nas a college like Warren College a are a\nvery engineering base though a lot of\ntheir other requirements still have to\ndo with maybe some more math classes\nsome more quantitative classes I don't\nactually know the requirements but you\ncan find them out pretty easily but I\nknow that Warren is pretty much known to\nbe the engineering college but you can\nbe any major and be in any college with\nthat which i think is actually really\ncool I actually like the college system\na lot you get to know the people in your\ncollege you take all your general\neducation classes with them and then\nyou'll take all those fun major classes\nwith the people in your major you get a\nkind of a little fun dichotomy that's a\nfun word dichotomy or you're taking GE\nrequirements with people you live with\nand then major requirements with people\nand other get up meet a lot of new\npeople also when you're applying to\ncolleges ear see has the best dorms ERC\nis also for all the freshmen they do\nlike fun games and stuff where you get\nto compete against the other colleges\nstuff like that just to get everyone\nnice and warmed up for the cold Ege also\nUCS T's campus is pretty interesting\nit's not like a normal college campus I\nwhen I remember when I toured it I got a\nvery like techy vibe almost like it's\nvery modern the way it's laid out it's\nnot like a like a Harvard or Princeton\nwhere they look sort of like castles\nvery like modern very techy a lot of\nlike contrasts things like that the\narchitecture is very interesting it's\npretty cool so if you're into that\nthat's also a plus one of the main\ndownsides is that it almost feels like\nthe university is a little bit greedy so\nit's like I pay so much in tuition\nI feel like I'm paying I have to pay for\neverything I have to pay for parking I\nhave to pay for food all the time I have\nto pay for like all these other things\nso it seems like universities a little\nbit greedy but again UC San Diego is\njust one of the UC system schools so\nit's pretty much gonna be the same\nthroughout all you sees but\nthat's just a major wall that I hear a\nlot like I hear the parking one a lot is\nthat there's no parking and it's\nexpensive to park like it's like $700\nfor the year to get a parking permit\nwhich is like ridiculous if I'm already\npaying so much for tuition also this\njust goes as a fair warning if you're an\nout-of-state student it is actually\nquite expensive for public university to\nstudy there again you see if she's a\nreally good school but if you're out of\nstate can it can hurt the pocket a\nlittle bit I was out of state for two\nyears of my college career and it was so\nexpensive for just two years it was so\nexpensive this the third year and coming\non to this fourth year it's so much\ndrastically cheaper and I get so many\nmore grants so if you can become a\nresident before you go to UCSD I really\nreally recommend that if you want to if\nyou want to save some serious coin my\ndudes some serious but to go on a little\nbit how is the math department in the cs\ndepartment at UCSD cuz that's what I'm\nmost familiar with math department you\nend up taking a lot of theoretical\nclasses for my major and they're pretty\ndifficult but you end up learning a lot\nlike I feel like they make the classes\nactually pretty hard but that will\nreally prepare you for the workforce so\nsometimes you just got to get the work\ndone for CS classes so I only take half\nmy classes in the CS department I'm not\ncomputer science and engineering so not\nall my classes are in that but again\nit's very challenging the cs department\nhas extremely extremely smart professors\nalso if you can tutor for them I highly\nsuggest you do that looks great on a\nresume so if you're a freshman or gonna\nbe a sophomore and you've taken some CS\nclass I UCSD go apply to be a tutor for\none of those professors because you get\ninsane connections it looks amazing on a\nresume\nyou also get paid so no real downsides\nthere and so far I've honestly loved\nbeing at UCSD I don't I can't imagine\nwhat it would be like to go to another\nuniversity I've met so many amazing\npeople I've met so many amazing friends\nthat I never regret going to UCSD and\nmoving to California from New Jersey\nit's been an amazing decision so if\nyou're on the verge of it and things\nthat I've said kind of you know make a\nlittle bit of fire in you I highly\nsuggest you know maybe going on a tour\nor maybe accepting an offer if you you\ngot one also it's good to know that UCSC\nI actually think is on the rise in terms\nof prestige so every year we're just\nslowly climbing up the rankings also I\ndidn't know this when applying but UCSD\nis actually the second most to applied\nto school in the country after UCLA so\nit's a huge campus I think it's nearing\n40,000 students so a lot of the\nentry-level classes have really large\nlecture halls I'm talking like 300\npeople plus but then the upper division\nclasses have smaller smaller classrooms\nso if you probably if you don't want to\nbe in a large lecture hall not all your\nclasses will be like that but the\nbeginner ones will will definitely be\njust that as a warning but again overall\nwant to keep this quick UCSD is not\nsocially dead if you try I think the\nclasses are great they're very\nentertaining you learn a lot the\nprofessors are awesome moat for the most\npart I think the programs are great\ngreat like I think the programs are\ngreat the architectures there are really\ninteresting is very modern campus\nthere's the six College System wits\nwhich makes it an interesting dynamic\ngives you something extra to talk about\nwhich college are you and which college\nare you what other GES like all those\nintro you know questions when you first\nget to college and the only real\ndownsides I think is that sometimes\npeople complain a lot because they're\nthere and you know you can't really help\nthat the fact that it's a little bit\nexpensive what are you gonna do it's\nCollege unfortunately it is expensive\nthose are just my thoughts quick little\nvideo about what it's actually like\nstudying at UCSD as you can see this\nepisode's border is the Geisel library\nit's pretty cool it looks like a\nspaceship so that's so that's one cool\nbenefit of going to UCSD but again if\nyou go as a lot of the video consider\nhitting that score up subscribe button\nconsider hitting that like button\nconsider tuning in to another future\nvideo my name is Michael that is the new\nname I'm going by I mean my name is\nMichael but Mars otter used to be the\nchannel name I just changed it again\njust more of an aesthetic choice I look\nI just like it a little bit better I'll\nsee you guys in another\n[Music]",

    "transcript": "[Music]\nokay good morning guys so today we're\nfilming a campus tour of our school\nbecause when we applied literally\nthere's nothing on the air\nand its really old so I wanted to show\nyou guys our school also like we go to\nlike one of the best beautiful campus is\nschool so like it's interesting to see\njust to like you know be jealous but\nalso like if you're applying like

little grassy area\nthis is like facing the outside of our\nschool so those apartments over there so\nwhen you get older you can move there or\nif you find a way to move off campus\nfreshman year then that's what you can\ndo also\nokay this lighting is terrible but it's\na requirement to live on campus for two\nor two years so freshman's offer you\nhave some on campus will show you guys\nthe freshman dorms cuz like sophomore\ndorms if you go here you'd figure that\nout so over here is the alumni send\nAlumni Center cookbook and then this is\nour dining hall our only dining hall\nthat we have will take you guys inside\nof there and then there's also like a\ncouple other things in that building\nthat will show you and then this is like\nthe main entrance when you come in here\nyou go

building\nthere's like they have like it's like\ntwo big forum kind of internship fairs\nand like if someone's doing like a big\npresentation it'll be in there so\nthere's a lot going on yeah they have\nthe bank is like downstairs and you go\ndownstairs if you have problems with\nlike your schedule or registering and\nlike or financial aid like there's a lot\nmore important stuff yes but I mean if\nyou get it they'll tell you all that I\nknow you guys don't care so think so\nthere's also a tram that you can take\nthat takes you basically around the\nentire campus there's different versions\nof the trim but you just make sure you\nhop on the right one and it could take\nyou basically like to your dorm if\nyou're a freshman or like sophomore\ndorms it takes you there or if you're\ngoing to the gym I get to drop you off\nlike right there so it's really\nconvenient um this is just it looks\nreally green outside\nokay so this building right here is\nsmaller hole it is a freshman dorm slash\nclasses are in there as well the first\nand the second floor our classes and\nthen the third fourth fifth I think they\nhave a sixth floor is dorms but all\nfreshmen yeah so this is a place I don't\nknow really what this is but you can sit\nover here and there's like places to sit\nlike a long and here as well and it's\njust really pretty there's a fountain\nit's just really nice to just chill\nbefore class especially the building\nover there is also the classroom\nbuilding so it's nice to sit in here if\nyou have classes and either one of those\nbuildings yeah let's go into more harm\nokay um I don't want to say this is what\na typical classroom looks like but this\nis more of a like large lucky yeah so go\nto the windows because most classrooms\ndo have a view from what I'm thinking of\nespecially like on this side of campus a\nlot of them are a lot nicer expand but\nyou can see like down into like but yeah\nwe'll go down there but it's like a\ncourtyard area that you can chill oh\nthis is just the back road just so\nhere's Maher right here and we came down\nthose steps and then we're just walking\nalong the road it's really empty today\nbecause today is a Saturday so like\nusually campus is like a little bit more\ncrowded but honestly our school like\nunless it's like passing periods for\nclasses it's really not that common yeah\nit's pretty nice um this is the male\ncenter right here so like you just get\nemails every time you get a package or a\nletter and then you come here to pick it\nup and look at it for you okay so this\nis um I almost don't know what this is\ncalled this is like a field or something\num sometimes they'll have little events\nout here like for yeah Greek life and\nthen sometimes clubs will have little\nevents on this line I'm on this side\nthis is the health center very important\nthis is a part of the building maher\nthat we were just in with all of the\ndorms and the classes so yeah the health\ncenters in there they're pretty pretty\nhelpful in there they you can sit\noutside to do whatever you want\nyou can eat out here yeah um so this\nbuilding right here\nare not building it's just a part it's\nlike the bottom part of mockers so like\nif you're in Maher you can literally\ntake the stairs now\nyes so this is a Roma's is it open okay\nso this is a Roma's I probably will\ninsert a picture over Alma's because\nit's really cute inside I didn't want to\nfilm on a school day because it's just\nloud and like you wouldn't be able to\nhear anything but yeah it's really cute\nin there you can also sit outside here\nand eat you didn't sit here in a chance\nand then right across is our church so\nour Immaculata which I will explain in a\nsecond as we make our way over there\nthis is coming off of the Roma's & Maher\nand then you have another little field\nagain that can be used for oh yeah there\nare little quirks on campus like we'll\nhave some like free stuff which is\nreally cool another fountain and it's\nreally pretty here like this just looks\nso gorgeous\nhonestly our campus is so beautiful it\nactually it shocks me oh can you open up\nso this is the Immaculata building right\nhere is very important because it has\nthe financial aid office which like you\ncan go when the school doesn't give you\nenough money and just like fight your\ncase to get more money yeah so that's\npretty important they have a bulletin\nboard right outside of the financial aid\noffice with a bunch of jobless listings\nso like if you ever if you have a car\nhere it's a lot easier it's a lot of\nthem are like not on campus it'll be\nlike parents might are like oh my Sunday\nit's a French tutor or my daughter needs\na math tutor and you could sign up for\nthat so that's pretty cool yeah yeah so\nlet's go continue our journey so yeah\nthis is like I don't know like the\npurpose of these stairs but it just\nlooks nice you people sit out here all\nthe time yeah and then there's weird is\nlucky yeah I want to give the view from\nhere so this is nice during Christmas\ntime they put up a huge Christmas tree\nright here which is really cute and they\ndecorated the whole Krampus for\nChristmas which is cool the perks of\nbeing a Catholic school they really care\nabout Christmas so this is the other\nhalf of campus yes come on cheese Plaza\nis over there but we're gonna make our\nway down man um we're not gonna show you\nthese buildings right here because um\nit's the nursing and that's not anagram\nbut these are like not relevant to you\nright now so but we'll show you guys the\nother buildings so this is usually the\ntypical walk to class\nso over here we have a founders Hall or\nyeah yeah founders and then Kamino\nthey're connected but I'll show you guys\nthe connection\nthis is also an all-girls dorm and then\nKamino is all boys but they're connected\nand then also out here I always sit out\nhere to do homework it's really nice and\nthen they have like the big chairs and\nyou can sit in those little chairs there\nno this is entering the camino and\nfounder's oh it's really pretty in here\nso camino is on this side and then\nfounders is on that side and then\nthere's also back there is an auditorium\nand on time yeah and founders has its\nown chapel it does yes\nso there's another church but it's not\nas used as they Immaculata the big one\nthat we showed you yes this is really\npretty you could also sit out here as\nwell our campus is designed to look\nreally nice so like you'll see a lot of\nthings that you're like why is it there\nwe don't know either so you can sit out\nhere this is like first floor of Caminos\nall classrooms yes and then the second\nfloor is like the guys dorm so yeah um\nbut like guaranteed you will have a\nclass plus if you will have a class in\neither Camino or founders I don't know\nanyone that's never had a class in here\ncuz a lot of the language classes are in\nhere and you meet you pass language so\nit'll be there\nthose aren't like the vet commune\nfounders aren't the nicest buildings but\nthey're there\nlike it cuz I think you're look like the\nkameen bros they caught ya and I keep\nit's all the guys founders girls thank\nyou guys like I'll get really close so a\nlot of people who live here say they\nlike it but I wouldn't I\nyeah I if you're gonna pick a dorm I\ndon't recommend this one but I mean like\nit looks to you if you want to live with\nall girls if you want to live with like\nall girls are all guys up to you yeah um\nso this is where you could during normal\ntimes of the weeks and days when there's\nnot an event people just kind of sit out\nhere yeah the lounge out here a lot of\ntimes one of the frats has dogs so\nthey'll just like sit over there and you\ncan play with their dogs it's really\ncool and then when there's like certain\nevents like club fairs and stuff they'll\nhave them out here we're reaching kind\nof near the end of campus because\nhonestly the campus is not big owl like\nit takes you maybe like 15 minutes to\nwalk from where we started to all the\nway to the end which is really fast in\nmy opinion and that's like kind of\nleisurely walking some people do it in\n10 minutes so yeah you can do it in 10\nminutes so it doesn't matter this\nbuilding right here do you want to\nexplain clock I don't even\nlike business so if you're like business\nmajor or business classes like me or\nlike probable classes are it's a nice\nbuilding it is this is just like the\nview from the other side of collages\nPlaza really nice getting a little cold\nbecause it's windier down here because\nwe're getting closer to the ocean so you\ncan also sit out here as Hawks tuning\nand then there's another fountain down\nthere guys wow what a concept\nokay let's go to the library because\nthat's really cool actually um so this\nis Camino sound yeah Camino and founders\nand then right next to it is the library\nit's called Copley or Coakley I honestly\ndon't know and I don't think anyone\nreally knows there's ever infinite\ndifferent ways so you can also sit out\nhere as well there's a lot of places to\nsit and chill on campus which is really\nnice\nso that was the library we didn't really\nshow too much because it was there's\npeople in there and we tried to show you\nthis one room called the Harry Potter\nBooya but there was an event in it\nbut if you look up like Harry Potter\nroom or like library on the Internet of\nus you'll see it it's a really quite fat\nareas like for really quiet study I'm\nnot as quiet as the law library as we\nmentioned before buts so really really\nquiet and then the main part you could\nkind of like whisper to your friend yeah\nbut like overall the library is not a\nplace for social I think like if you\nwant to talk and study you could\nliterally just sit outside of the\nlibrary right there and talk so yeah\nlet's continue our journey so this is\nessentially the end of campus like these\nbuildings that's basically as far back\nas campus goes you would just go down\nthis hill with your car and you exit out\naway but I mean this is basically a\nstudent wise so this building is called\nmother Ruth Lee their classes inherit\nplus but I had my readiness like\nfreshman year writing\nyeah so nice but we'll show you croc\nwhich is right there and they're kind of\nlaid out the same way this is the view\nfrom the back of mother Rhodes Lee which\nhonestly is so nice like guys like come\non like this is insane the oceans\nliterally right there that little blue\nline yeah that's the Pacific Ocean it's\nthe baby okay whatever it leads out into\nthe ocean yeah\nso this we don't actually have to walk\nall the way down here cuz it's close but\nback here it's called Bert's Bistro and\nas ways you can get food on campus it's\nusually open from like lunchtime to\nreally dinner like think it closed up\nfive or six um yeah they have some\nburritos of burgers the burgers are so\ngood um good smoothies actually really\ngood smoothies they know how bagels oh\nyeah they do Vegas yeah just like\nthey've sushi Annie like sushi boy yeah\npokeballs and like sushi rolls yeah\nlike drinks so yeah it's a good place to\neat yeah and there's also chairs over\nthere and then you sit outside and then\nyou can look at the ocean I mean come on\nlike what are you doing okay so we're\ngonna show you guys croc this is a Joan\nB Kroc building and then this is La\nPalma which is attached to it\nand here's another fountain guys oh\nhere's a little hummingbird so cute but\nhere you can also sell outside guys we\nhave like 50 fountains on this campus I\ndon't know why it looks nice and then\nthere's a lot for my I think Bob bomb is\nprobably close Champa\nblob was in one of my vlogs my previous\nvlog I put La Paloma in there so if\nyou're really curious to know what it\nlooks like it's on there\nyeah I I always like daydreaming class\nit's so bad huh yes if you go to class\nin here it's really nice like you'll\nwant to come to class because the\nbuilding is just so nice and like you\njust feel happier yeah this is literally\nthe prettiest part of campus it's\nhonestly so beautiful we can walk around\nthis side actually and show you guys but\nit's just so like so pretty like why is\nthis here I don't know but it's really\nnice so this is actually now because\nthat was not here this is a picture with\nmy brother and me on it oh okay I'm\nlying too\nso this is just like the end of campus\nyou can connect she's like yeah like all\nof San Diego basically cuz we're in a\nvery central location\nthere's like the main stuff if you're\nnot going out on campus there's a bunch\nof food down there yes that's like the\nway you go to go to the beach yes it's\njust so pretty\nsandy knows where it's on shyly I've\nnever had a class in here such I'm\nputting up wait this looks so nice oh my\ngod\n[Music]\nWow another yet another beautiful view\nyou can lose some garden back here and\nfun fact the plants and stuffs like\nswirls so it forms a teammate helix\ndid you away oh my gosh look so cool\nyeah oh wow okay go off go so yeah this\nis another view I mean it's just nice\nlike and I've eaten back here like a\ncouple times because the library is\nliterally like two minutes away like\nit's literally a walk across the street\nso I've liked studying at the library\ncome back here to eat take a break and\nthen walk back to sunny so nice\nyeah this is really nice and all of your\nscience classes would be in this\nbuilding you don't have but most most to\nall if you're not a science major and\nyou're just taking the basics it should\nbe in here\non to the next so this is kind of just a\nback route this is where we just came\nfrom this building right here shyly and\nthen there was la paloma which really\ngood food they have like breakfast all\nday and sandwiches and salads and\nnoodles and those have a coffee shop in\nthere too yeah so this is Rockaway I'm\nalso parking on campus\nyou cannot just park anywhere you want\nyeah if you need you can park after 7:00\nyeah yeah but before that\nfor\nallowing people who have\nyes also benches over here that you can\nsit it'll look out see the view really\nnice\nyeah I look you think I had a costume\nhere no my goes low huh they're all\nconnected but this is just kind of the\nmiddle of two buildings we're like below\nground no us you could say I have my\ncomputer science class in here building\nTVs perspective where er that is ma her\nHall which was the building that we the\nfirst like dorms we showed you the\nfreshman dorms yeah I've thought I here\nbefore before class yeah probably\nbut it's really nice you didn't have\nlike computer labs just take our word\nfor it here's some stairs yeah actually\nyeah it is quite done huh this is the\nview walking back I know it's so nice\nthat's like the law school building\nthat's really all thanks it's for\ngraduate students oh yeah that is\nrelevant for undergrad that's not oh and\nthis is the football field it's kind of\nfrom a weird angle and I'm literally\nshouting because we're right next to\nlike a street the main street but this\nis the football field it was kind of\nzoom in here you can see they're playing\nfootball I don't know why because\nfootball seasons over base they also\nplay soccer on here and rugby so it's a\nmulti-purpose field and that down there\nis missions where\nwe lived last year like freshman dorms\nand then up there's like the gym and\nstuff and then that's up there's where\nwe live now so as you can see up this\nway is a main campus that was where the\ndining hall was the very first thing\nthis is like a parking structure where\nI'm a few live admissions you can park\nin there and then along here and then\nhere are our first set of dorms so this\nis missions B it's a freshman dorm\nthere's a lot of different buildings and\nyou can live in either one missions is\ndefinitely the best place to live in my\nopinion so this is just sort of what it\nlooks like here there's various\ndifferent buildings so this is missions\na this is another this is where I lived\nwith me and my friends we lived in\nmissions a and then there was missions B\nover there so this is missions a\nmissions I there's also like in missions\nthere's like a little park thing down\nthere that you could chill out I know\nthis is a view that you have in missions\na if you get placed on this side like up\nagainst the wall but yeah you can\nbasically see like everything there's\nthe ocean\nright along there\nand there's main campus out there it\nlooks very far but it's really not\nthere's like a little pathway along the\nside here that can take you all the way\nup to main campus yeah this is mission a\nand it's really cool I honestly think\nthis is the best dorms and the dorms are\nupdated and they're really big so it's\nit's a good choice\nnow this building here's missions\ncrossroads and it's basically where you\ncan go in there and you can study\nthere's laundry at the bottom and it's\njust like a good place to get anything\nyou need and it's right by both of the\ndorms in missions so it's really\nconvenient so what this building here is\na sophomore dorm so these were this is\nmissions I this is the sophomore dorm\nand then in here it's closed right now\nbut this is mish CAF and it's just like\na little cafe it's pretty good they have\nacai bowls bagels sandwiches salads\nbasically anything smoothies so yeah\nlook along this way this is just more of\nmissions be over here so this is another\ndorm you can live in\nI always forget about the storm it's\ncalled sand one last year when I was a\nfreshman it was a sophomore dorm and\nthis year it's all freshmen so it's kind\nof cool cuz you get your own balcony\nalso guys I forgot to mention that on\nthe top of where mish CAF was where the\nlittle cafe was is a gym so there's two\ngyms on campus there's the one\nadmissions and then there's like the\nmain gym but yeah so that was Sam one\nmissions be the gym and the missions a\nis like over there okay cool\ncontinue the journey this is essentially\nthe same view I showed you guys before I\nshowed you guys from missions a so they\nkind of look out on that angle and then\nthis is coming from just an angle from\nthe parking lot but it's really cute\nbecause you can like sit up here on a\nlittle bench and just look out and it's\nso pretty like guys come on\nand it's very green because it's been\nraining here a lot but I mean look at\nthis it's just magnificent and you can\nalways see the Sun setting over there\nwhich is really cute too at night\nyeah so those are a bunch of random\nhomes up there we're gonna continue on\ndisplay walking through the parking lot\nbut like if you come to school to USC\nfor one thing you should come for the\nview so I want to mention that this is a\nCanyon a lot of people go on runs down\nhere walks because there's a pathway\ncarved out and it's relatively safe so\nif you enjoy running and stuff like that\nthen this would be really good for you\nas well so right here is our gym yeah I\ndon't know import it say about that I'll\ninsert pictures of X I don't want to go\nin and like record and disturb people\nbut yeah so this is a gym and also like\na basketball court is in there as well\nbut we use the vassal court for like\nother things too sometimes so this is\nour field the baseball fields our team\nis actually pretty good and then on the\nother side of the baseball field there's\nanother field down there and it's\nbasically the practice field for all the\nsports that would use so one of the last\nfew stops on our little tour is we have\na pool and honestly anyone keeps the\npool I must start like some practice\ntime but they also have chairs where you\ncan just round out here and it's really\nnice and then this building here if you\ndo any intramural sports you would play\nthem in here and so it's really cool\nlike anywhere basketball I'm like like\nvolleyball and then soccer is played\nelsewhere but\nyeah so I think this is one of the best\nperks because you can honestly all the\ntime you can lounge by the pool because\nthe weather is always so nice so yeah\nthis building can also is also\nessentially our rec center so if you\nwant to take any like yoga classes\nballet classes dance classes like most\nof the time they would be in this\nbuilding up here so I'll give you a\nperspective of where I am as you can see\nso here's the football field and there's\nmain campus and then this is the\nbuilding we're just not where the pool\nis and everything so guys that concludes\nmy tour of USD I hope you guys like the\nvideo be sure to like it and subscribe\nand leave a comment down below on any\nquestions you have and I'll be sure to\nanswer them and I'm also making a\nseparate video on tending snow before\nyou come to USD so look out for that\nyeah\nokay bye guys see you next video\n[Music]",

    "transcript": "preseason testing is done and dusted and\nthat means just one thing it's time for\nthe 2024 Formula 1 season to get\nunderway and for Tech talk where should\nwe start to look other than one of the\nmost interesting and important cars that\nwe've seen for a while let's take a look\nit is of course the\nMercedes I'm not looking at the wrong\ncar by the way this is of course last\nyear's Mercedes the 2023 Mercedes W4 and\nI just want to draw your attention to a\ncouple of points on this car which will\nbe coming up in this video take a look\nat the design of the tip of the nose of\nthis all black car this is early in the\nseason last year and then as I play this\nclip forwards we can take a look at\nanother interesting feature on the car\nhave a look at what is nicknamed The\nGreat Wall concept this big swooping\ndown section with a really high side of\nthe engine cover now that's not\nsomething we're going to see on the\nMercedes this season at all but you are\ngoing to to see it during the 2024 F1\nseason where are you going to see it\nwell where else than at Red Bull of\ncourse Red Bull have adopted that exact\nsame Great Wall philosophy that Mercedes\ntrialed and ultimately dropped so let's\ngo and have a look at the brand new\nMercedes because that car in itself is\njust absolutely fascinating here it is\nin pre-season testing and I just want to\ndraw your attention again to the tip of\nthe nose of the car and you can see just\nhow different it truly is the shape of\nthe nose is fundamentally different on\nthe new car than it is to the old but\nalso from a structural point of view\nit's worth noting that the nose only\nconnects to the second element of the\nfront wing and not the leading element\nof the front Wing like it used to that's\nsomething that's become a bit of a trend\namongst the teams up and down the grids\nand it's something they all seem to have\ncopied from last year's Red Bull Red\nBull though have gone a completely\ndifferent direction and copied last\nyear's Mercedes well Mercedes have\ndecided to do their own thing well the\nfront wing of the Mercedes as well is\ninteresting for other reasons because\nquite a lot of teams have noticed and\nwe've all noticed and commented on this\nsection of their front Wing the fourth\nelement of the wing such as it is F1\nteams are allowed to have up to four\nelements in their front Wing one two\nthree four but look at the outer element\nof the front Wing it's pretty standard\nin its shape all the way up to that\nCentral section where it's almost the\nwidth of my little finger it barely\nexists at all and to understand exactly\nwhat's going on with that section of the\nwing who better to talk to than the man\nwho created the car in the first place\nJames Allison the rules require that\nthat um that that any given flap so you\nyou can have four flaps that any given\nflap element has to sort of go from the\ntip of the wing to the to the to the\nroot of the wing and it can't stop\nhalfway so if you want if if you want a\nflap say outboard on the wing but you\ndon't you don't really want it inboard\ncuz you don't want the load that it's\ngoing to provide inboard on the wing\nthen one way to cope with that is to\nmake that Wing much small that flap much\nsmaller in the place where you don't\nreally want it to be doing its thing and\nthe rules allow you to shrink the flap\ndown uh so we've just done that in quite\nan extreme fashion so our flap is Broad\ncord where we want it to be but then it\ntapers away to a just sort little pencil\nthick\nuh in board moving backwards from that\nOho interesting front Wing the car\ndoesn't get any less boring the secret\nweapons of Mercedes were teased were\ntrolled by the F1 team coming into its\nlaunch they the Mercedes team issued\nthis 3D rendering of their new car and\nusually when you see these 3D renderings\nthey're absolute nonsense they bear very\nlittle similarity to the real F1 car at\nall but have a look here at the front\nsuspension\nwe thought this was a rendering error we\nthought it was a mistake by the team\nthey'd added in two rear legs of the\nupper Wishbone and that's just silly\nnobody's actually going to do that are\nthey well when we got to preseason\ntesting the third day of testing gave us\nall a little bit of a surprise check\nthis out now we've talked a bit about\nthis already but I think it's worth\ngoing a bit deeper into this so have a\nlook this is the top element of the\nfront Wishbone Arrangement that's the\nleading element there but have a look at\nthe lower element of the front Wishbone\ncomes in and picks up on the bit of the\nchassis just further rearwards and you\ncan see the angle between these two\nparts here that's pretty clear pretty\nstandard nothing to write home about but\non the third day of testing Mercedes\nturned up with something looking a\nlittle bit different and it took a while\nfor anybody to notice that the car had a\nfundamentally different front suspension\nlayout there's that same top element the\nlead the forward arm of the upper\nWishbone no change in that but look at\nthe rear leg of the lower Wishbone the\nangle is completely different it's\nmounted much lower down now some people\nthought oh well you can just adjust\nthese things you can mount things\ndifferently make an adjustment\nsuspension on racing cars is always\nadjustable but a change like that is\nfundamental to the design of the monoco\nthe design of the chassis of the car to\nchange a part like that you'd normally\nhave to introduce a completely new\nchassis or you'd have to have a big\ninsert into the side of the car that you\nhad to remove and put back in that would\nadd a huge amount of weight and in a era\nwhere weight is all important that's\nreally confusing but when we took a\ncloser look at the car coming into the\nbar Ranger on pre weekend a few Secrets\ndid get revealed and I have to pay\ncredit to Craig scarber for picking up a\nlittle bit of this because if you have a\nlook at this plate that sits on the\ninner edge of the chassis you can see\nwhere that Wishbone pickup point is now\nthis is in the high position which\nMercedes opted to go with for this\nweekend but underneath this single I\nthink it's pretty thin sheet of carbon\nfiber there is actually a second pickup\nPoint molded into the side of the\nchassis now this means it's a really\nconscious decision from the Mercedes\nteam to be able to switch from this\nupper position of the suspension to the\nlower position just like that pre-season\nrendering stated but to do that it's\nundoubtedly going to add weight to the\nstructure of the monoco itself because\nyou can't just make a choice like this\nand then just give up on it it is adding\nweight to the car so they clearly were\nunsure about the best position of the\nsuspension and will they switch between\nit during the season well to explain a\nlittle bit more about what they were\ndoing with this layout James Allison was\non hand in preseason testing to explain\nto Lawrence beretto yeah we saw I think\ntoday um our Tech analyst saw the front\nsuspension you were playing around with\nlike different positions of that I guess\nthat's what testing's for isn't it to\njust try and see what what works and\nwhat doesn't work so yeah I think\nspecifically you guys will have seen\nthat we were changing the anti-dive\nlevel on the front suspension and uh\nthat's exactly the sort of change that\nyou really can't do between runs in free\npractice sessions so um yeah useful to\nget that done and get a get a bunch of\nruns on it today compar to yesterday and\nmake our decisions fascinating stuff\nthere from James but let's hear what\nformula 1's Chief technical officer pat\nSimmons had to say about this concept\nbecause I think when he looked at this\ndesign in preseason testing his thoughts\nwere really really interesting yeah\nintriguing that one isn't it because at\nthe launch it was sort of notice people\ncommented on it uh people thought it was\na rendering error or something like that\nand uh yeah it's real life so uh I\nhaven't actually really had a a good\nlook at that yet um I guess my eye was\ntaken off the ball by the front Wing\nhell of an innovation if it's what we\nthink it is yeah yeah absolutely but you\nknow I guess that they've done this\nbefore with their steering system and\nthings so um you have to find all these\nlittle nuances and when people say oh\nthe rules are so restrictive you know we\nwe can't be creative anymore rubbish you\ncan be and they are now continuing our\nrearward tour through this brand new\nMercedes I thought we'd just stop off\nquickly and have a look at the roll hoop\nthis is something I like to do because\nthe roll hoop is a big old piece of\nengineering it's the highest point of\nthe car it's also has a big effect on\nthe center of gravity height and it can\nhave an impact on the weight\ndistribution of the car for Wards to\nrear one of the points everybody's\ntalking about is the driver's head now\nthis isn't Lewis Hamilton's head here\nit's one of the mechanics but the\ncockpit and driver's head position is\nfurther rearwards relative to the front\naxle something Lewis Hamilton hated last\nyear was being sat far too close to the\nfront wheels that's been moved rearward\nthis year and that's something the team\nhave had to change now the roll hoop\nitself is something that does look\npretty similar conceptually to all\nrecent Mercedes you've got this oval\nairbox and this A-frame for the rollover\nstructure itself and then you've got\nthese kinked forward remote supports\nthere'll be some more supports\nunderneath the Bodywork back here\nhowever this is something that all teams\nhave had to have modified coming into\nthis season because the regulations have\nmeant this structure needs to be a lot\nstronger with new low tests coming in\nfrom the top and the side and they have\nto meet those new more stringent tests\nso this has been redesigned\nre-engineered and that I can't really\nsee how teams have been able to not make\nthese designs a bit heavier but they're\ngonna have to make that trade-off\nElsewhere on the car now moving to the\nrear of the car it's always good to take\na look at the car from behind and you\ncan see a few little details here of the\ncar that just a worth looking at but a\nnot you know groundbreaking stuff you've\ngot a double lower beam Wing that's\nfairly standard that's something the\nteam will play around with the during\nthe season undoubtedly you got a\nslightly dished rear wing but again it's\nquite a big Wing again you're going to\nsee a lot of changes of that through the\nseason single rear pylon support little\nbit of the cooling rear cooling you can\ncan see some of the outlets and you can\nalso see this very distinctive Ferrari\ninspired gullied rear section that's\nsomething Mercedes adopted partway\nthrough last year and I've gone a bit\nfurther with this year but they're still\nnot as Extreme as say Aston Martin or\nAlpine in that concept of the car so\ncould they go a bit further looking\nunder the Bodywork there is a bit of\nspace to play with but looking at the\ncar from the rear is important because\nthe rear end of this Mercedes was the\nreal focus of James Allison and the\ndesign team going year on year and to\nEXP explain exactly what they were\nfocusing on well we asked the man\nhimself there are some specific things\nthat we wanted to make sure we got right\non this car we wanted to make sure that\nthe thing that both drivers have\ncomplained about for a couple of years\nwhich is that they don't trust the rear\nend that and they turn in they're not\nsure whether it's going to snap round on\nthem we wanted to cure that and that's\nnot an aerodynamic thing that's more of\na mechanical a mechanical thing making\nsure that the rear suspension presents\nthe tires to the road in a predictable\nway uh that doesn't get Disturbed as the\nload changes on the rear now with all of\nthat focus on the rear end Mercedes did\nopt to make a pretty fundamental choice\nat the rear of the car switching from a\npull Rod rear suspension to a push rod\nrear suspension design that's a really\nbig choice for the team and in order to\nachieve that they had to make some\nfundamental changes to the transmission\ncasing to explain exactly what they did\nit's that man again it's James Ellison\nwell went to a push rod because uh we\nwere finding it quite constraining\nhaving all of our inboard suspension the\nsprings and the dampers and the roll\nbars packaging them inside the gearbox\ncasing which is where they have to\nreside if you're using a pool Rod\nbecause the pool Rod comes down and then\nit joins up with all the Rockers and the\nSprings low down in the car where it's\ninside the gearbox switch to a push rod\nyou can get it on top of the box where\nit's more accessible therefore brings\nmore opportunities to you in terms of\nspring layouts and stuff so that's one\naspect of the change the more important\nchanges were uh just organizing the\nwishbones and the track rod in such a\nway as the uh suspension is much more uh\ncapable of keeping the rear axle pointed\nin a good direction presenting the\ncontact patch to the road in an\neffective way as the load comes on and\noff the tires with speed changes and\nwith low changes as you go around\ncorners so all of those little changes\nmade to the Mercedes will add up and\nmake a big difference and it's amazing\nhow far the team have come since they\nintroduced this so-called zero pod side\npod concept all the way back at the\nbeginning of 2022 nobody really liked it\nand it was introduced at Bahrain a few\nteams have taken a look at it as we've\nseen with Red Bull will they be able to\nmake it work later in the season if they\ndo I think it will be quite interesting\nto see if the legacy of this car the\nMercedes w14 or it's this car the\nMercedes W5 concept it works out to be\nthe real winner when it gets out on\ntrack",

are\nwatching I don't know\nhim guys guys one second one second\nJohnny hi welcome welcome to the show\nnice to have glad to be here I want to\nbegin by asking Johnny Johnny we're\ngoing to be watching a bunch of memes\nsome of them featuring you do you see\nmemes about yourself do they make you\nlaugh yes I honestly I love see memes\nabout myself it's great excellent you\nknow what guys we're going to drop\nJohnny's Instagram Twitter etc etc in\nthe description everybody watching from\nIndia please go drop a meme that you\nthink is hilarious to Johnny let him\nknow on his social Johnny do you watch I\nI still watch some yeah besides shooting\nI'm also I'm a regular Dude too so I\nhave so of course do you like watch your\nown videos not so much my own videos and\nI can't watch videos of people I know\neither like my friends it has to be\nlike amateur videos of people I don't\nknow at all your I'll send you my\nvideo link description guys I will come\nacross some of my old videos though that\nI totally forget doing have no\nrecollection of and I do like to watch\nthose ones because I I don't remember\nthem at all it makes sense because I I I\nread that like Michael Jordan used to\nwatch his games after they were done\nJohnny one personal question I'm asking\nfor a friend uh I've been told that pawn\nis all fake and 2 minutes is enough\napparently\nright I've have seen a lot of your\nvideos and I just wanted to ask how many\ntimes have you lost your\nvirginity probably not that many on\nvideo because I I started a little bit\nwhen I was like 26 so I was already kind\nof beyond the losing virginity stage\nJohnny if you are ever looking for\nanother actor or co-actor you know just\nreach out to me I can be the husband\nwatches\nsorry I know everyone's got like all\nthese hilarious questions but I have one\nreally serious question that I have to\nask you in in 2013 when Dallas Buyers\nClub and her and gravity were fighting\nfor best pictures do you feel like come\nspoil [ __ ] was\nrobbed\ndefinitely by the way guys Johnny and us\nalready shot a podcast so I know a bunch\nof questions that you guys have uh we've\nalready probably already covered them on\nthe podcast that's coming out on the\nsecond Channel link should be in the\ndescription if we have the questions out\nof the way should we watch some memes I\nthink we should watch some memes let's\ngo family Strokes step step sister screw\nstep brother next to Blind dad imagine\nbeing interviewed for a porno thinking\nyou're going to get coochie but you end\nup as the role of a blind dad he never\nsaw it\ncoming husband doesn't\nwatches what's worse is the the guys\nthat have to sleep adoring the whole\nscene oh yeah\noh the guy who usually sleeps do they\nchitchat during Cuts or what do they do\nwell usually I mean if you're doing a\nscene and there's extras around or\nsomeone's pretending to sleep or be in\nthe room it's usually pretty funny so as\nsoon as you C like everybody just starts\nlaughing this totally happened to me not\nthe part where he gets knocked out or to\nskinny [ __ ] but I wore a blue shirt\nonce yeah happened to me\nalso do adult stars do they pay\nattention to the comments on like\nPornHub like what people are saying\nfeedback they giving I don't know about\nso much about PornHub I don't think\nthere's really any constructive\ncomments what constitutes for a\nconstructive piece of advice well I\nthink when I used to shoot for brazers a\nlot they would have a comment section on\nbrazers and a lot of those comments I\nfelt they were kind of constructive The\nProducers know who they like to see in\nthe scenes what they like to see what\nthey liked about the scene what they\ndidn't and you know the producers\nperformers whoever reading it could read\nthat and granted it's just one person's\nopinion you could kind of get a a you\nknow who liked the scene who didn't by\nthe com they had the power to hire guys\nor not hire guys because if enough\npeople complained about the guy in the\nscene Brad would stop hiring them if the\ncomments were like I hate this guy I\nhate this guy this guy sucks get rid of\nthis guy mostly when you watch one you\nhate the guy only\nso by the way guys just let you guys\nknow if you guys leave enough comments\nthen uh we can speak to Kulu separately\n[Laughter]\nif you have a jack off and

whatever it is it's\nnever really that serious sometimes\nusually you don't even get a script\nuntil you're on set that day you get a\nscript and for me I always just wanted\nto get through the script as fast as\npossible I just want to get the sex part\nknow I know got to memorize my lines so\nthat way you get done faster amazing\nthat Bollywood movies and B are shot in\nthe same\nway do you do you decide like oh we do\nwe do this position first then we go to\nthis then we go to this then we go to\nthis choreography sometimes it depends\non the company the director some\ncompanies like it

had this\nfeature where if you just H over a video\nit would just show you some of the\nscenes like it just show you like like a\nJF like that the most best technical\ninvention of like I think it's the best\nJohnny but in the span of your career\nlike of course only fans was like the\none big disruption that happened\nanything else that you think of that's\nchanged in the industry significantly\nover the last couple of decades well I\nknow when I first got in the industry\nwas just transitioning into basically\ninternet scenes as opposed to dvdc the\ninternet blew the industry up basically\nbecause now all of a sudden companies\nneeded a scene day three scenes a day to\nto put out whereas a DVD you only shot\nfour or five scenes a month and then of\ncourse the introduction of HD cameras\nkind of changed everything too that\nhappened when I first was in I remember\nmy first or second year on Seth they\nswitched from standard definition to 720\nHD and the girls were freaking out\nbecause they were like oh no now you can\nsee everything VR Pawn is a new big\nthing right that's something I've been\nreally diving into have you have you\nshot any VR Pawn Johnny no haven't shot\nVR porn it's very difficult for the guy\nbecause the guy just has to lay there\nbasically like you're dead you can't use\nyour arms you can't do anything so you\njust lay there the girl

once you use\nit the first time the novelty kind of\nwears off the your hand is the best\nthing\nrespect that that's what I was going to\nsay you know when you're Bard off the\nhand just go for the left hand it feels\ndifferent it feels like a new toy it's\ncompletely different B up users I fear\nno man but that\nthing it scares\nme Johnny what's the biggest screen\nyou've seen yourself on time

    "transcript": "Hello, friends!\nIs democracy over in our country?\nThis is a very serious question.\nMany of you will have a \nsimple answer to this question:\nObviously not.\nWe can vote for any political party we want.\nThe politician who gets the most votes,\ncomes in power,\nso obviously democracy still exists in our country.\nBut this question is much deeper than that.\nThe things that I am going to \nshow you in this video today\nwill be very shocking.\nAfter watching this video, you will be forced to think\nabout the real answer to this question.\nAlthough, if you are someone\nthat considers PM Modi to be a god,\n\"He is our god.\nWe worship him.\"\n\"Prime Minister Modi, \nhe is God's incarnation to us.\nHe is not a normal human.\"\n\"This country's Prime Minister is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu.\"\n\"God incarnate.\" \nOr if you are someone \nwho thinks that Modi's every action helps humanity,\nif you're already in awe of PM Modi,\n\"Modi is my husband, \nmy brother, my father, my teacher.\"\n\"-Okay.\n-What do you want to say?\"\n\"Why do you feel like no one other than \nModi or Yogi can bring development?\" \n\"I am in love with him.\"\nIn such cases,\nit might be difficult for you\nto open your eyes and look at the truth.\nBut for the rest of the viewers,\nif you truly care about the country,\nwatching this video is immensely important.\nIt's not just about one incident,\nbut many such incidents\nthat are happening one after the other,\nfor the past few months, \nfor the past few years.\nAll those incidents point to one thing,\nthat our country is moving forward towards One Nation, One Party.\nEradicating the voice of the opposition from the media,\nhorse-trading of the MLA's,\nthe taking away power from the elected governments\nby making new laws.\nWeaponisation of investigative agencies.\nPressuring and imprisoning \nopposition politicians through ED and CBI.\nInterfering in state governments' work through governors.\nWithholding funds from state governments.\nTaking away the right of the citizens to protest.\nAnd if someone protests,\nwelcoming them with tear gas and rubber bullets.\nUsing electoral bonds to hide their funding.\nAnd even if an opposition candidate manages to win the election,\nthen committing election fraud \nto declare themselves the winner.\nI would like to tell PM Modi,\n\"Have some decency!\"\nBefore talking about democracy, friends,\nit is important to know what democracy actually is.\nIt is a basic concept\nbut most people have a major \nmisunderstanding of this concept.\nSome people think that\nif there are regular elections in the country\nand you can go to vote,\nthen it means that the country is a democratic country.\nBut you know what?\nElections are held in North Korea too.\nI am not kidding.\nThere are regular elections in North Korea.\nYou can also see 100% voter turnout in those elections.\nBut the only difference is that\nif you do not vote for the official candidate elected by the government,\nyou are considered anti-national.\nYour job can be snatched away,\nyour house can be snatched away.\nAnd if it's just about the word democracy,\nthen the official name of North Korea,\nthe word democracy is included in it.\nNorth Korea is called the DPRK by their government.\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea.\nBut what is the truth?\nThis country is a dictatorship.\nSimilarly, Russia is also considered a dictatorship.\nBut elections are held there too.\nThe only difference is that any candidate \nwho competes against Putin\nis sometimes disqualified for some reason,\nor sometimes k!lled mysteriously.\nSo, one thing should be clear from this\nmerely having elections does not mean\nthat the country is a democracy.\nElections need to be free and fair.\nFree means that the people have freedom\nto vote for whom they want to\nand Fair means that\ndifferent candidates and different political parties\nhave a fair chance of winning.\nIt shouldn't be that one party has a lot of advantages.\nRecently, the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation held its Mayor elections.\nFor this election, Congress and the AAP had formed an alliance,\nand had a total of 20 votes out of 35.\nIt was clear by the party votes that\nthis alliance would win the elections.\nBut when the elections actually took place,\nwhat did the presiding officer do?\nThis is not a secret.\nYou can see the CCTV footage of what he did.\nHe declared 8 Congress and AAP  votes as invalid.\nAnd this election fraud that took place here,\nwas captured in the CCTV camera.\nIn fact, he was caught looking at the camera too.\nLook at his face.\nThe way he is looking at the camera,\nit looks like he was caught stealing.\nAnd what was the result of the election?\nBJP claimed to have won this election.\nSuch an open election fraud\nhas probably never happened in the country before.\nThe Chief Justice of India said that\nthis is a m*rder of democracy.\nAlthough in a historic decision, the Supreme Court\nhad to save this election,\nthe question is,\nif there were no CCTV cameras here\nor ballot papers,\nwould this fraud have been caught?\nThis is just one example, friends.\nBefore that, look at this news from 2021.\nAn EVM machine was found in a BJP candidate's car in Assam.\nAfter this, the Election Commission had to order a repoll in this place.\nBut no need to talk about old news.\nLook at this month's news.\nFebruary 2024.\nThree unknown people went to the Saswad Tehsil office in Pune\nto steal the control unit of the electronic voting machine.\nIs this a joke?\nAre our elections being conducted in a free and fair manner?\nThe Election Commission is an organisation\nwhich is expected to conduct free and fair elections across the country.\nBut the Election Commission has been accused\nof being partial and biased.\nThis accusation is very old.\nInitially, BJP politician Narendra Modi had made this accusation.\nYou heard it right.\nBefore the May 2014 election,\nNarendra Modi accused the Election Commission.\nAlthough he won later elections.\nBut in the last 10 years,\nthe Election Commission has been accused so much that\nPrashant Kishore said that\nthe Election Commission is an extension of BJP.\nHe says that he has never seen such a \npartial and biased Election Commission.\nThat this Commission has always tried to bend the rules.\nAnd tried to make the schedule of elections in such a way that\nBJP always benefits.\nThe Election Commission has given very clear directions\nthat the Indian Army cannot be mentioned during political campaigns. \nBut before the 2019 elections, PM Modi,\nshamelessly asked for votes\nusing the martyrs and airstrikes.\n\"I want to ask my first-time voters that\ncan your vote be dedicated to \nthe brave martyrs in Pulwama?\"\nChief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath, went on to\ncall the Indian Army as Modi's Army.\n\"And Modi's army sh**ts the terr0rists.\"\nWhen a complaint was filed with the \nElection Commission regarding this,\nno action was taken for 21 days.\nAnd after 21 days, the Election Commission gave its clean chit.\nThe rules are clearly written,\nthey are being openly violated\nbut still a clean chit.\nIt's not the only clean chit,\nPM Modi has got such clean chits in at least 4 different cases.\nAmit Shah compared Rahul Gandhi's constituency with Pakistan.\nThis is also against the rules.\nBut the Election Commission has given clean chits in this too.\nIn total, there are 7 such cases\nin which Modi and Shah have received clean chits.\nNDTV had also reported that\none out of three election commissioners,\nhad a dissenting opinion \nin 5 out of the 7 cases.\nIt means that there was an election commissioner\nwho believed that they should not be given clean chits.\nLater, it was found that the name of this \nelection commissioner was Ashok Lavasa.\nDo you know what happened to him later?\nHis wife, son, daughter, and sister all got \nnotices from the government agencies.\nThe Citizen Commission on Elections in their report stated that\nAshok Lavasa was silently removed from the election commission.\nJust think, this is an election commissioner,\nis this a democracy or a dictatorship?\nIn a democracy, separation of powers,\nindependence of institutions,\nis something you must have read about in school.\nOur Supreme Court had given an order\nto strengthen the independence of the election commission.\nTo have the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners\nbe appointed by a three-member committee.\nOne of whom will be the Prime Minister,\nthe other will be the opposition leader\nand the third will be the Chief Justice of India.\nBy doing this, it could be ensured that\nthe Election Commissioner who is being appointed\nwill be truly independent.\nThere will be no bias towards any entity.\nBut a few months ago,\nthe government brought in a new law\nin which the government said that\nthe Chief Justice of India would be removed from this committee.\nInstead, they added their minister to the committee.\nSo, in three-member committee,\ntwo of them will be from the government\nto appoint the Election Commissioner.\nIf BJP's intentions were clear,\nthen why was such a law passed?\nWhy does the government want to control \nthe appointment of the Election Commissioner?\nThis was later challenged in the Supreme Court,\nbut the Supreme Court did not take any action here,\nsaying that this falls under the separation of powers.\nIf the government is making a law,\nthen the Supreme Court does not want to strike it.\nEven today, the Election Commission has set a limit on\nhow much money can be spent on an MLA election and an MP election.\nIn an MP election, the limit is ₹9.5 million.\nBJP contested the election on 437 seats.\nSo, the total spending of the party\nshould not have been more than ₹4.15 billion.\nBut how much did they spend? \nIt is written on the website of the Election Commission,\n₹12.64 billion.\nhow did the Election Commission allow this?\nThe Center for Media Studies also estimated that\nBJP had spent ₹270 billion in the previous elections.\nWhich was 45% of the total expenditure.\nIf you look at the data of today,\nelectoral bonds worth ₹160 billion have been sold.\nOut of these ₹160 billion, \nmore than ₹100 billion went to BJP,\n₹15 billion to Congress\nand ₹8 billion to TMC.\nAll these amounts surpass the spending limit of the election.\nBJP leader Uma Bharti once said,\n\"Elections are a choice between bad and worse.\"\nWhich is true.\nBut think about it.\nIf a social worker who has dedicated his life to serving people,\nhow will he be able to bring ₹9 million to contest an election?\nHow will he be able to promote himself?\nEspecially when on the other side, \nthe party has billions of rupees.\nThe problem isn't limited to elections.\nEven if an opposition party forms the government,\nthe government is then broken apart.\nHere, countless allegations have been \nlevied against the BJP for horse-trading.\nPeople have repeatedly accused BJP\nof taking MLAs to some resort\nand buying them with an unimaginable amount of money.\nAre these allegations of horse trading true?\nI cannot tell you because\nI have never been to that resort.\nBut you can imagine,\nall those MLAs in the resort won't be merely playing Ludo.\nInvestigative agencies are responsible \nfor investigating such allegations.\nBut if all the investigative agencies\ndance to the tune of a single political party,\nthen who will investigate these allegations?\nNow imagine what would be going on in the MLAs' homes.\nThe politician who buys these MLAs,\nwhat would he say to his family?\nProudly telling them the good news\nthat he suppressed the voice of the people.\nThat he str@ngled democracy.\nHoping to be praised.\nAnd the other MLA, who sold his soul for some money,\nwhat would he tell his family?\nProudly showing the money he brought in.\nBy maligning the integrity of the nation by falling for horse-trading.\nCelebrating his lack of integrity.\nIt's easy to get angry at such politicians,\nbut they're pitiful too.\nHow miserable they are,\nhow low they have fallen.\nHorse-trading and luring politicians with money is just one way.\nIf an MLA doesn't fall for this,\nthe second way is to use the investigative agencies.\nUsing ED,\nweaponisation of ED.\nLast year 14 political parties had \ncomplained to the Supreme Court\nabout how the government is using CBI and ED\nagainst opposition leaders.\nThey said that they have carried out \nmore than 3,000 raids on political leaders.\nIf you compare it with 2014,\nyou can see a 4 fold jump in the number of ED cases against politicians.\nAnd 95% of the cases are registered against opposition parties.\nIn response, ED said that their conviction rate is very high.\nThe conviction rate is 96%\nbecause the trials in 25 cases are over\nand there was a conviction in 24 cases.\nBut the truth is that from 2005 till now,\nED has registered more than 5,900 cases.\nThe trial was conducted in only 25 cases.\nAnd the conviction was in only 24 cases.\nThat translates to only 0.5% of the cases being substantial.\nWhenever an opposition politician is accused of corruption\nand he joins BJP,\nall charges vanish suddenly.\nAll cases against him are dropped.\nSomeone had even written a poem on him.\n*Washing Powder Modi*\n*lies and frauds*\n*it hides everything*\n*even serious allegations disappear in a blink*\nWhen Himanta Biswa Sharma was in Congress,\nhe was accused in the Saradha Chit Fund Scam.\nCBI called him for questioning in November 2014.\nAnd since 2015, when he joined BJP,\n7 more allegations of corruption have been filed against him.\nOne allegation is about a land scam,\nanother allegation is that he is running \nsyndicates in the silk and muga industry.\nBut since he joined BJP,\nthere have been no investigations on him.\nBy the way, the list of politicians who \nwent in BJP's washing machine is very long.\nMany of these politicians were previously \nmentioned by PM Narendra Modi in his speeches\nas examples of corruption.\nCalling NCP the Naturally Corrupt Party, \nand asking people to never vote for them.\nBut as soon as these leaders joined BJP,\nthe investigations stopped\nand the corruption scams were forgotten.\nBJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had once said\nwhere someone has to rely on corrupt individuals to gain power,\nhe said that he wouldn't want to get near that power.\n\"If I get power,\nI don't even want to touch such power with a tong.\"\nBut that era was completely different.\nThat BJP and today's BJP,\nare vastly different.\nToday when Nitin Ghatkari is asked about Modi's washing powder,\nhe answers with a smile that\nBJP's detergent is eco-friendly.\nIt's important to win in elections,\nand the winner decides what's right or wrong.\n\"BJP's soap is washing away everyone's scandals in a washing machine.\"\n\"It's an eco-friendly detergent.\"\nWhom do you agree with more?\nPresent-day Nitin Gadkari\nor the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee?\nComments below.\nEven despite the lure of money \nand the pressure of ED,\nif an opposition politician doesn't join BJP,\nthe proceedings against them continue.\nAnd in many cases,\nthey are put in jail without being convicted.\nAnd they remain in jail for many months.\nAAP MP Raghav Chadda said that\nif Manish Sisodia, Satyendra Jain, Abhishek Banerjee, Sanjay Raut,\nFarooq Abdullah, and Tejashwi Yadav join BJP,\nall the cases by ED and CBI against them\nwill be dismissed immediately.\nAnd people like Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain who are in jail\nwill be released immediately.\nNow, to imprison someone after a conviction is a different matter.\nBut here, opposition politicians are being \nsent to jail before they are convicted.\nThe worst thing is that in the states where opposition governments exist,\nthey are not allowed to work there.\nNot just one or two, but many states have\nrepeatedly accused the Modi government that\nthey are using governors to interfere in the state's day-to-day affairs.\nThey are preventing the state governments from working.\nThe West Bengal government has said this.\nThe West Bengal governor has been repeatedly blamed for this.\nThe Tamil Nadu government has said this.\nThe Delhi government has said this.\nThe Kerala government has said this.\nLast year, the Kerala government even accused the governor\nof delaying the bills passed by the state government for 2 years.\nDelaying the bill's approval.\nThe state of Kerala even complained to the Supreme Court about this.\nThe Supreme Court said that the governors cannot delay bills like this.\nThat this is unconstitutional.\nThe issue between the LG and the Delhi government in Delhi\nhas been in the news for many years.\nOver the last few years, \nCM Kejriwal has repeatedly said that\nthey are not allowed to work.\nThe LG interferes in their work.\nThe Delhi government approached the Supreme Court for this\nand the Supreme Court's decision was in their favour.\nThe Supreme Court stated that\nLG should not interfere in this way.\nThe real power should be in the hands of the elected government.\nBut what did the Central Government do \nafter the Supreme Court's decision?\nThey brought a new law\nto take away the powers of the Delhi government.\nGNCTD,\nGovernment of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023.\nThe Modi government used this\nto transfer many powers vested with \nthe Delhi government to the LG.\n\"We changed the hospitals.\nWe made them grand.\nWe arranged for all the medicines.\nThey forced the officers to disrupt the flow of medicines.\nThey stopped the tests.\nLast year, for three months, no tests could be run in the mobile clinics.\nThey stopped the payments to the laboratories.\nThey play dirty and are disgusting people.\nBy passing one order one day,\nthey removed the data entry operator \nin all the government hospitals in Delhi.\nNow there is no one left to register patients in the hospitals.\nI ask them, what do you want to do?\nDo you want to k!ll the people of Delhi?\"\nThink about it yourself, friends.\nEven if you are a Modi fan, \nforget about him for a second\nand ask yourself sincerely.\nIf PM Modi was really worried about the country,\nthe people of the country,\nwould he have done such things?\nNow some of you will think that\nsurely some opposition party has funded me to make this video.\nBut I am telling you the truth,\nno political party has funded me.\nThe things that I am showing you in this video\nrepresents the reality of the country.\nIf you are really concerned about the country,\nthen you should open your eyes after seeing these things.\nNews Laundry revealed an investigation report two days ago\nthat shows ED is used not only against other political parties,\nbut also against companies in the country.\nAt least 23 such companies which\nhadn't donated any money to BJP yet.\nCentral agencies raid their premises\nand a pattern emerges.\nAfter the raid, those companies donated millions of rupees to BJP.\nIn total, these companies donated ₹3.35 billion to BJP,\nwhich were subjected to IT or ED raid.\nSo, were these companies threatened to extort money?\nAre our elections held in a free and fair manner?\nHere, the media also plays an important role too.\nFair elections mean that the politicians of \nthe ruling party and the opposition\nare given an equal chance to speak.\nBoth get more or less equal media coverage.\nBut what do we see in the media?\nDay and night, 24*7, the media sings praises the government. \nThey praise the ruling party.\nOr repeat their talking points.\n\"Every mother in the country wants her son to be like PM Modi.\nand every son wants to be like Narendra Modi.\"\n\"Modi has the solution to everything.\"\n\"There's no one like PM Modi.\"\n\"Modi built the New India.\"\n\"PM #1\"\nOpposition parties may go on a Bharat Jodo Yatra,\nto make promises to the government.\nThere was a time when on Doordarshan \nthe politicians of the ruling party and the opposition party,\ndebated on important issues before the election on the news channel.\nBoth had the right to defend their stance.\nCan today Doordarshan do this?\nToday, the BJP spokesperson doesn't even need to speak\nbecause TV anchors have become BJP spokespersons.\nInstead of questioning the government on behalf of the people,\nthey defend the government.\nAnd they defend the government to an extent that\nthey might start to hold the youth \nresponsible for increasing unemployment.\nAnd if you have elected an opposition party in the elections,\nthen they will start insulting the people.\n\"And the people have turned away \nfrom the national issues and BJP.\nThey choose to vote based on \nwhich party will give them free stuff.\"\nNDTV was the last TV channel\nwhich dared to question the government.\nUltimately, NDTV was taken over by PM Modi's friend, Gautam Adani.\nToday, TV news has d!ed a silent de@th in our country.\nThe government uses tax money to\ngive huge amounts of money to these TV \nchannels for running 'advertisements'\nand these TV channels work to suppress the voices of the citizens.\nIf the real news doesn't reach you,\nwill you be able to decide freely and fairly who to vote for?\nManipur was set ablaze for 77 days,\nbut there were no special reports on TV channels.\nRecently, the CAG of India presented 12 reports,\nwhich had a lot of irregularities\nand instances of corruption\nin government departments and ministries.\nUnder the Ayushman Bharat scheme, \nmore than 900,000 people\nwere using only 3 mobile numbers.\nMillions of rupees were spent on the treatment of 3,400 patients\nwho were already declared dead.\nWhen this CAG report came out,\nthe government transferred the CAG officers.\nHave you heard this news on TV channels?\nYou haven't.\nHow will it reach you?\nThe second misunderstanding that people have is\nthey confuse democracy with majoritarianism.\nImagine that you are travelling in a car with 5 people.\nOne person in the car says that he wants to listen to loud music.\nHe convinces his friend and the driver\nthat they should play loud music in the car.\nBut you are travelling with your father who has a heart problem.\nYou say that loud music should not be played.\nThat person says, that all of you should \nvote to prove that it's a democracy.\nAnd three people voted that loud music should be played.\nYour father and you, are the two people, \nwho say that loud music shouldn't be played.\nSince the majority voted to play loud music\nin a democracy, it would mean that loud music will be played in the car.\nIs this really democracy?\nNo, this is stupidity.\nTo give you a small-scale example in real life,\nthen look at this circular from a society in Gurgaon.\n\"Dear Residents,\nThis is to inform you that\ntwo wheeler not permitted inside our society\nas per decision of the management.\"\nIt means that only cars will enter the society,\nscooters and motorcycles cannot.\nLook at the unabashed discrimination.\nThe management, the RWAs,\nhave been elected by the people.\nSo even if you don't like this rule, you would need to keep quiet.\nBecause the majority has consented to this,\nthey have elected the RWLO.\nPeople who confuse democracy and majoritarianism,\nmust be thinking this.\nThis is not just about one society,\nthere are many such societies all over the country\nwhere you will find such stupid rules if not stupider.\nLook at this article from 2019.\nA bank employee is saying that her sister didn't get an apartment on rent.\nBecause many RWOs blacklisted her\njust because her sister was an air hostess.\nSome societies say that they can't rent an apartment to an air hostess\nbecause of their odd work timings.\nOften, these RWAs make up any baseless rule they want to.\nFor example, in some societies in Noida,\nentry and exit fees have been imposed.\nAnyone who wants to rent an apartment in these societies,\nwill have to pay an entry fee.\nAnd they will, of course, be required to pay the rent to the landlord,\nbut when they leave the society,\nthey have to pay an exit fee.\nThe majoritarianism at the local level in the country,\nSome people think this about politicians and governments.\nOnce the politicians are elected and they are in power,\nthey can make any rule they want.\nOn the Preamble to our Constitution,\n4 words are clearly written\nLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, and Justice.\nThese 4 words are the cornerstones of democracy.\nIn fact, Dr. Ambedkar went one step further.\nHe said that these 4 words are the principles of life.\nSo, a majority vote doesn't mean that\nyou can take away someone's natural rights,\ndiscriminate against them or make nonsense rules.\nThis is why we can say that some of the decisions taken by the government\ngo against democracy.\nIn the language of the Supreme Court,\nthey are unconstitutional.\nLike just a few days ago,\nthe Supreme Court struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme\ncalling it unconstitutional.\nThe court said that the government had made an arbitrary rule.\nWhy was this Electoral Bonds Scheme unconstitutional\nand against the welfare of the people?\nI have talked about this in previous videos.\nSo, it was a good step by the Supreme Court\neven though the decision was a bit late,\nbut at least the took the right decision\nin favour of democracy and the people.\nBut holding the government accountable\nis not only the Supreme Court's responsibility,\nbut in a real democracy,\nthis is the job of the opposition,\nmedia, civil society, and the citizens.\nAnd for this reason,\nmechanisms like RTI, Right to Information Act, exits.\nWhich gives us data about the government.\nFor the same reason, the media is called the fourth pillar of democracy,\nso that it will hold the government accountable.\nBut what is the situation today?\nTill date, PM Modi has held zero press conferences\nwhere unscripted questions have been asked.\nAccountability is at absolute zero.\nForget the press conference,\nhe doesn't have the courage to face one unscripted question.\nWhen Dr Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister,\nhe held press conferences or addressed the press at least 117 times.\nThe last time a proper press conference was held in our country\nby the Prime Minister,\nit has been more than 10 years since that day.\nIn that last press conference,\n62 unscripted questions were asked to PM Dr Manmohan Singh\nwith more than 100 journalists present.\nIn a true democracy,\nthis accountability is the reason\nwhich gives the citizens the right to protest.\nIf the managers elected by our country\nare not interested in being held accountable under the RTI,\naren't comfortable with being accountable to the media,\nthen they will have to be held accountable by the citizens.\nA positive example of this was recently seen in UP\nwhen the UP government made a very strange and undemocratic rule.\nThey issued guidelines for coaching centres\nthat they should not conduct classes for girls after 8 pm.\nIf they do, action will be taken against them.\nAnd what was the government's justification?\nThat it was necessary for the safety of girls.\nBut does this make any sense?\nInstead of controlling the ones who are a threat to girls,\ninstead of controlling the problematic elements,\nthey tried to put the girls in cages.\nprotested against these rules.\nAnd after the protest,\nthe UP government withdrew the ban.\nThis small incident shows\nthe power of the people in a democracy.\nBut what if the right to protest is taken away from people?\nRecently, when farmers had to go back to the streets to protest again,\nthe government welcomed them with sharp nails.\nIn some places, roads were dug\nto completely block the roads.\nThen rubber bullets were fired at the farmers,\ntear gas was thrown at them, using drones.\nAs if this was a war zone.\nThe photos of the border crossing made it look like\nthis was the national border with China.\nEven there, there are no arrangements like this.\nAnd in the news, it is being reported that\nat least 3 farmers went blind\nbecause of the rubber bullets fired by the police.\nWe will talk about the reasons behind this protest\nand the demands of the farmers\nin a separate video.\nBut for now, this doesn't matter.\nThe point here is that\nthe government treating citizens peacefully protesting like this,\nIs this right?\nBefore this, there was the wrestlers' protest.\nThe police behaved similarly back then too.\nThis was the case in the last farmer protest too.\nNumerous farmers lost their lives during the protest.\nAccording to an article from 2021,\nat least 600 farmers were killed in the last farmers' protest.\nAnd these are the protests that you get to hear about in the news\nbecause these protests have gotten bigger than a certain limit.\nApart from this, most of the protests that were held over the last few years\nhave never been talked about in the news.\nDid you know about Kashmiri Pandit's protests that lasted more than 40 days?\nAbout the government employees protesting against the old pension scheme,?\nOr the protest in Hisar that continued for more than 400 days?\nAgainst the closing of the Doordarshan Kendra,\nOr the doctors' protest last year,\nor the protest by the unemployed youth.\nDon't delude yourself that this has nothing to do you,\nsince you are not taking part in these protests.\nBecause tomorrow, if you are subjected to any injustice,\nif the government takes any decision\nthat goes against your rights.\nAnd you go out to protest to defend your rights.\nWhat do you think?\nWon't you be treated the same way\nthese farmers are being treated today?\nAre you special?\nIf the government is treating all the protesters this way,\nthen you won't get any special privilege.\nNow this question that I asked you at the beginning of the video,\nI would like to ask again.\nIs democracy still alive in the country today?\nWhatever your answer may be,\nbut one thing is for sure,\nif the situation continues to deteriorate this way,\nit will not take much time for us to fall \nto the levels of North Korea and Russia.\nDemocracy will exist on paper,\nelections will also be held,\nbut in the real sense,\ndemocracy will have breathed its last breath.\nThank you very much!",

    "transcript": "hey everyone welcome to the first an\nintroductory lecture for cs25\ntransformers united\nso cs25 was a class that the three of us\ncreated and taught at stanford in the\nfall of 2021 and the subject of the\nclass is\nnot as the picture might suggest it's\nnot about robots that can transform into\ncars it's about deep learning models and\nspecifically the particular kind of deep\nlearning models that have revolutionized\nmultiple fields starting from natural\nlanguage processing uh to things like\ncomputer vision and reinforcement\nlearning to name a few\num\nwe have an exciting set of videos lined\nup for you we have some truly fantastic\nspeakers come and give talks about how\nthey were applying transformers\nin their own research\nand we hope you will enjoy and learn\nfrom these talks um this video is purely\nan introductory lecture to talk a little\nbit about transformers and uh before we\nget started i'd like to introduce the\ninstructors so my name is advair i am a\nsoftware engineer at a company called\napplied intuition before this i was a\nmaster's student in cs at stanford\nand\ni'm one i am one of the co-instructors\nfor cs25 uh chaitanya div if the two of\nyou could introduce yourselves\nso hi everyone i am a phd student at\nsample before this i was uh\npursuing a master's here um researching\na lot in general modeling enforcement\nlearning and robotics uh so nice to meet\nyou\nyeah that was div for since he didn't\nsay his name\nchaitanya if you want to introduce\nyourself\nyeah uh hi everyone my name is chaitanya\nand i'm currently working as an ml\nengineer at a startup uh called move\nworks before that i was a master student\nat stanford specializing in nlp and was\na member of the prize filling stanford's\nteam for the alexa price challenge\nright awesome\nso\nmoving on to the\nrest of this talk\nessentially\nwhat we hope you will learn watching\nthese videos\nand what we hope uh\nthe people who took our class in the\nfall of 2021 learned\nis three things\none is we hope you will have an\nunderstanding of how transformers work\nsecondly we hope you will\nlearn and by the end of these talks\nunderstand how transformers are being\napplied beyond just natural language\nprocessing\nand thirdly we hope that some of these\ntalks will\nspark some new ideas within you\nand hopefully lead to new directions of\nresearch new kinds of innovation and\nthings of that sort\nand\nto begin we're going to talk a little\nbit\nabout transformers and introduce some of\nthe context behind transformers as well\nand for that i'd like to hand it off to\ndiv\nso hi everyone\num so welcome to our transformer seminar\nuh so i will start first with an\noverview of the attention timeline uh\nand how it came to be uh the the key\nidea about transformers was the\nself-potential mechanism uh that was\ndeveloped in 2017 and this all started\nwith this one paper called retention is\nall you need i was on youtube uh before\n2017 we used to have this prehistoric\nera where we had uh older models like\nrnns lstms and uh simpler attention\nmechanisms and eventually like the\ngrowth in transformers has exploded into\nother fields and has become prominent in\nlike\nall of machine learning and uh i'll go\nand see and show how this has been used\nso in the prehistoric era there used to\nbe rnns\nthere were different models like the\nsequencer sequence lstms gius\nthey were good at encoding um some sort\nof memory but they did not work for\nencoding long sequences and they were\nvery bad at encoding context so here is\nan example where you if you have a\nsentence like i grew up in france dot\ndot dot so i speak fluent dash then you\nwant to fill this with like a french\nbased on the context but like a lsd\nmodel might not know what it is and\nmight just make a very big mistake here\nsimilarly we can show some sort of\ncorrelation map uh here where if we have\na pronoun like it we wanted to correlate\nto one of the past nouns that we have\nseen so far like a animal\num but again uh older models were like\nreally not good at this context encoding\nso where we are currently now is on the\nverge of takeoff we've begun to realize\nthe potential of transformers in\ndifferent fields we have started to use\nthem to solve long sequence problems in\nprotein folding such as like the alpha\npole model from gp from open from\ndeepmind\nwhich gets 95 percent accuracy on\ndifferent challenges in offline rl uh we\ncan use it for few shot and zero\nstructuralization for text and image\ngeneration and we can also use this for\nlike content generation so here is\nexample from openai where you can give a\ndifferent text prompt and\nhave an ai generator fictional image for\nyou\nand uh so there's a\ntalk on this that you can also watch in\nyoutube which basically says that ls\nstudents are dead and long-lived\ntransformers\nso what's the future\nso\nwe can enable a lot more applications\nfor transformers um they can be applied\nto any form of sequence modeling so you\ncan use we could use them for video\nunderstanding we can use them for\nfinance and a lot more so basically\nimagine all sorts of genetic modeling\nproblems\nnevertheless there are a lot of missing\ningredients so like the human brain we\nneed some sort of external memory\nunit which is the hippocampus for us and\nthey are saying some early works here so\none nice work you might want to check\nout is called this neural tuning\nmachines\nsimilarly uh the current attention\nmechanisms are very computationally\ncomplex in terms of time and they scale\ncorrectly which we will discuss later\nand we want to make them more linear and\nthe third problem is that we want to\nalign our current sort of language\nmodels with the how the human brain\nworks and human values and this also big\nissue\nokay so now i will deep dive deep dive i\nwill\ndive deeper into the tension mechanisms\nand uh show how they came out to be\nso\ninitially there used to be very simple\nmechanisms um where attention was\ninspired by the process of importance\nreading or putting attention on\ndifferent parts of uh\nimage where like similar to a human\nwhere you might focus more on like a\nforeground uh if you have an image of a\ndog compared to like the rest of the\nbackground\nso in the case of soft retention what\nyou do is you learn this simple soft\nattention weighting for each pixel which\ncan be a weight between zero to one uh\nthe problem over here is that this is a\nvery expensive computation and then you\ncan as show as as it's shown in the\nfigure on the left uh you can see we are\ncalculating this attention for the whole\nimage um\nwhat you can do instead is you can just\nuh\ncalculate a zero to one attention map\nwhere we directly put a one on wherever\nthe dog is and a zero wherever uh it's a\nbackground uh this is like uh less\ncomputation expensive but the problem is\nit's non-differentiable and makes things\nharder to drain\nuh going forwards we also have different\nvarieties of basic attention mechanisms\nthat came that were proposed before\nself-retention\nuh so the first\nvariety here is global tension models so\nin global attention models for each\nhidden\nlayer input a hidden layer output you\nlearn an attention weight uh a of b\nand this is element twice multiplied\nwith your current output to calculate\nyour final output uh yt\num similarly you have local attention\nmodels where instead of calculating the\nglobal attention for over the whole\nsequence length you only calculate the\nattention over a small window\nand uh and then you wait by the tension\nof the window in into like the current\noutput uh to get like the final output\nuh so moving on uh i will pass on to\nchattanooga to discuss self-retention\nmechanisms and transforms\nyeah uh thank you this for covering a\nbrief overview of how the\nprimitive versions of attention work\nnow just before we talk about\nself-attention uh just a bit of a trivia\nthat this term was first introduced by a\npaper which from line it all which was\nuh which provided a framework for a\nself-attentive uh\nuh frame a self-attentive mechanism for\nsentence and weddings and now moving on\nto the main crux of the transformers\npaper which was the self-retention block\nso self-retention is the basis is the\nmain uh comp building block for the how\nfor what makes the transformers model\nwork so well and to enable them and make\nthem so powerful so to think of it more\neasily uh we can uh break down the\nself-retention as a search retrieval\nproblem so the problem is that given a\nquery queue and uh we the we need to\nfind a set of keys k which are most\nsimilar to q and return the\ncorresponding key values called v\nnow these three vectors can be drawn\nfrom the same source for example we can\nhave that q k and v are all equal to a\nsingle vector x where x can be output of\na previous layer in transformers\nthese vectors are obtained by applying\ndifferent linear transformations to x so\nas to enable\nthe model to capture more\ncomplex interactions between the\ndifferent tokens at different places of\nthe sentence\nnow how attention is computed is just a\nweighted summation of the similarities\nbetween the\nquery and key vectors which is weighted\nby the respective value for those keys\nand in the transformers paper they used\nthe scale dot product as a similarity\nfunction for the queries and keys\nand another important aspect of the\ntransformers was the introduction of\nmulti-head self-retention so what\nmulti-head self-retention means is that\nthe retention is for at every layer the\nself attention is performed multiple\ntimes which enables the model to learn\nmultiple representation subspaces\nso in a way you can think of it that\neach head is\nhas a uh has a power to look at\ndifferent things and to learn different\nsemantics for example one head can be\nlearning to try to predict uh what is\nthe part of speech for those tokens one\nhead might be learning what is the\nsyntactic structure of the sentence and\nuh and all those things that are there\nuh to understand what this uh what the\nupcoming uh sentence means\nnow to better understand what the\nself-attention works and what are the\ndifferent computations there is a short\nvideo\nso\nin this so as you can see\nthere are three incoming tokens\nso input one input to input three we\napply linear transformations to get the\nkey value of vectors for each input\nand then give once a query queue comes\nwe calculated similarity with the key\nwith respect to key vectors and then\nmultiply those\nscores with the\nvalue vector and then add them all up to\nget the output\nthe same computation is then performed\non all the tokens\nand we get the output of the self\nretention layer so as you can see here\nthe final output of the send self\nretention layer is in dark green that's\nat the top of the screen\nso now again for the final token we\nperform everything same queries\nmultiplied by keys we get the similarity\nscores and then those similarity scores\nobey the value vectors and then we\nfinally perform the addition to get the\nself attention output of the\ntransformers\napart from self retention there are\nsome other necessary ingredients that\nmakes uh the transformers so powerful\none important aspect is the uh presence\nof positional representations or the\nembedding layer so\nthe way rnns worked\nvery well was that since they process\neach the information in a sequential\nordering so there was this notion of uh\nordering right and which is also very\nimportant in understanding language\nbecause we all know that we\nread\nany piece of text from\nleft to right in most uh\nin most of the languages and also right\nto left in some languages so there is a\nnotion of ordering which is lost in kind\nof self-attention because every word is\nattending to every other world that's\nwhy this paper introduced a separate uh\nembedding layer for introducing\npositional representations\nthe second important aspect is having\nnon-linearities so if you think of uh\nall the computation that is happening in\nthe cell potential there it's all linear\nbecause it's all matrix multiplication\nbut as we all know that deep learning\nmodels uh work well when they are able\nto uh when they are able to learn more\ncomplex mappings between input and\noutput which can be uh attained by a\nsimple mlp\nand the third important component of the\nself\nof the transformers is the masking so\nmasking is what allows to parallelize\nthe operations\nuh since every word can attend to every\nother word in the decoder part of the\ntransformers which otherwise gonna be\ntalking about later is the problem comes\nthat you don't want the decoder to look\ninto the future because that can result\nin data leakage so that's why masking\nhelps the decoder to avoid that future\ninformation and learn only what has been\nhow what uh what the model has processed\nso far\nso now on to the uh the encoder decoder\narchitecture of the transformers\nyeah thanks tethanya for talking about\nself-attention\nso\nself-retention is sort of the key\ningredient or one of the key ingredients\nthat allows transformers to work so well\nbut at a very high level the\nmodel that was proposed in the vaswani\nat all paper of 2017 was like previous\nlanguage models in the sense that it had\nan encoder decoder architecture what\nthat means is let's say you're working\non a translation problem you want to\ntranslate english to french the way that\nwould work is you would read in the\nentire input\nof your english sentence you would\nencode that input so that's the encoder\npart of the network and then you would\ngenerate token by token the\ncorresponding friends translation and\nthe decoder is the part of the network\nthat is responsible for generating those\ntokens\nso\nyou can think of these encoder blocks\nand decoder blocks as\nessentially something like lego they\nhave these sub components that make them\nup\nand in particular the encoder block has\nthree main sub components the first is a\nself retention layer um that chaitanya\ntalked about earlier and as talked about\nearlier as well you need a feed forward\nlayer after that because the\nself-retention layer only performs\nlinear operations and so you need\nsomething that can capture the\nnon-linearities\num you also have a layer norm after this\nand lastly there are residual\nconnections between different encoder\nblocks\nthe decoder is very similar to the\nencoder but there's one difference which\nis that it has this extra layer because\nthe decoder doesn't just do multi-head\nattention on the output of the previous\nlayers so so for context the encoder\ndoes multi-head attention\nso each\nself-retention layer in the encoder\nblock\nin each of the encoder blocks does\nmulti-head attention looking at the\nprevious\nlayers of the encoder blocks the decoder\nhowever does\nthat in the sense that it also looks at\nthe previous layers of the decoder but\nit also looks at the output of the\nencoder and so it needs us a multi-head\nattention layer over the encoder blocks\nand lastly there's masking as well um so\nif you are because every token can look\nat every other token um you want to sort\nof make sure in the decoder that you're\nnot looking into the future so if you're\nin position three for instance you\nshouldn't be able to look at position\nfour and position five\nso those are sort of all the components\nthat led to the creation of the model in\num the vasani idol paper\nand\num let's talk a little bit about the\nadvantages and drawbacks of this model\num so the two main advantages which are\nhuge advantages and which are why\ntransformers have done such a good job\nof\nrevolutionizing\nmany many fields within deep learning\num are as follows so so the first is\nthere is this constant path length\nbetween any two positions in a sequence\nbecause every\ntoken in the sequence is looking at\nevery other token\nand this basically solves the problem\nthat they've talked about earlier with\nlong sequences you don't have this\nproblem with long sequences where if\nyou're trying to predict a token that\ndepends on a word\nthat was far far behind in a sentence\nyou don't have the problem of losing\nthat context now the distance between\nthem is only\none in terms of the path length\nalso because the nature of the\ncomputation that's happening transformer\nmodels lend themselves really well to\nparallelization and because of the\nadvances that we've had with gpus\nbasically if you take a transfer model\nwith n parameters and you take a model\nthat isn't a transformer say like i can\nhave stm with also with n parameters\ntraining the transformer model is going\nto be much faster because of the\nparallelization that it leverages\nso those are the advantages\nthe disadvantages are basically\nself-attention takes quadratic time\nbecause every token looks at every other\ntoken order n square as you might know\ndoes not scale and there's actually been\na lot of work in trying to tackle this\nso we've linked to some here big bird\nlin former and reformer are all\napproaches to try and make this linear\nor quasi-linear essentially\nand\nyeah we highly recommend to\nrecommend going through jay alamer's\nblog the illustrated transformer which\nprovides great visualizations and\nexplains everything that we just talked\nabout in great detail\nyeah and i'd like to pass it on to\nchaitanya for applications of\ntransformers\nyeah so now moving on to like some of\nthe recent work uh some of the work that\nuh very shortly followed the\ntransformers paper\nso one of the models that came out uh\nwas gpt the gbt architecture which was\nreleased by open eyes so uh so open ei\nhad the latest model that opened here\nhas in the gpt series is the gpd3 so it\nconsists of only the decoder blocks from\ntransformers and is trained on our\ntraditional language modeling task which\nis uh predicting the current token which\nis separating the next token given the\nlast uh t tokens that that the model has\nseen\nand for any downstream tasks now the\nmodel can just you can just train a\nclassification layer on the last hidden\nstate\nwhich can be\nwhich can have any number of labels and\nsince the model is generative in nature\nyou can also use the pre-trained network\nas uh for generative kind of tasks such\nas summarization and natural language\nand natural language generation\nfor things for that instance\nanother important aspect that gpt 3\ngained popularity was its ability to\nto be able to perform in context\nlearning what the authors called into\ncontext learning so this is the ability\nwherein the model can perform can learn\nunder few short settings uh what what\nthe task is to complete the task without\nperforming any gradient updates for\nexample let's say the model is shown\na bunch of addition examples and then if\nyou pass in a new uh input and leave the\nuh and just leave it at uh at equal to\nsign the model tries to predict the act\nnext token uh which very well comes out\nto be the sum of the uh the sum of the\nnumbers that's that is shown another\nexample can be also the spell correction\ntask or the translation task so this is\nthis was the ability that uh made gpt 3\nso much uh uh talked about in the nlp\nworld and uh right now also like many\napplications have been made using gp3\nwhich includes uh the\none of them being the vs code co-pilot\nwhich uh tries to\nwhich tries to generate a piece of code\ngiven our doctrine kind of natural\nlanguage text\nanother major uh model that came out\nthat was based on the transformers\narchitecture was bird so but uh lends\nits name from it's an acronym for\nbi-directional encoding encoder\nrepresentations of transformers\nit consists of uh only the encoder\nblocks of the transformers which is\nunlike gpd3 which had only the decoder\nblocks\nnow this prop because of this change\nthere there comes a problem because\nuh because bert has only the encoder\nblock so it sees the entire piece of\ntext it cannot be pre-trained on a live\nlanguage modeling task because of the\nproblem of data leakage from the future\nso what the authors came up with was a\nclever idea and they uh and they came up\nwith a novel task called mass language\nmodeling which was uh which included to\nreplace certain birds with a placeholder\nand then the model tries to predict\nthose words given the entire context\nnow apart from this token level task\nthere was the authors also added a\nsecond objective called the next\nsentence prediction which was a sentence\nlevel task\nwherein given two chunks of text\nthe model tried to predict whether the\nsecond sentence followed the other\nsentence or not follow the first\nsentence or not\nand now for after pre-training this\nmodel for any downstream task the model\ncan be further fine-tuned with an\nadditional classification layer just\nlike it was in chip e3\nso ah these are the two models that were\nthat have been like very popular and\nhave made a lot of applications made\ntheir way in lot of applications but the\nlandscape has changed quite a lot since\nwe have taken this class there are\nmodels with different pre-training\ntechniques like elektra d berta and\nthere are also models that do\nwell in like other modalities and which\nwe're going to be talking about in other\nlecture series as well\nso yeah that's all from this lecture and\nthank you for tuning in\nyeah um just want to just want to end by\nsaying thank you all for watching this\nand we have a really exciting set of\nvideos with truly amazing speakers and\nwe hope you are able to derive value\nfrom that\nthanks a lot thank you thank you\neveryone\nyou",

    "transcript": "hey everyone welcome to the first an\nintroductory lecture for cs25\ntransformers united\nso cs25 was a class that the three of us\ncreated and taught at stanford in the\nfall of 2021 and the subject of the\nclass is\nnot as the picture might suggest it's\nnot about robots that can transform into\ncars it's about deep learning models and\nspecifically the particular kind of deep\nlearning models that have revolutionized\nmultiple fields starting from natural\nlanguage processing uh to things like\ncomputer vision and reinforcement\nlearning to name a few\num\nwe have an exciting set of videos lined\nup for you we have some truly fantastic\nspeakers come and give talks about how\nthey were applying transformers\nin their own research\nand we hope you will enjoy and learn\nfrom these talks um this video is purely\nan introductory lecture to talk a little\nbit about transformers and uh before we\nget started i'd like to introduce the\ninstructors so my name is advair i am a\nsoftware engineer at a company called\napplied intuition before this i was a\nmaster's student in cs at stanford\nand\ni'm one i am one of the co-instructors\nfor cs25 uh chaitanya div if the two of\nyou could introduce yourselves\nso hi everyone i am a phd student at\nsample before this i was uh\npursuing a master's here um researching\na lot in general modeling enforcement\nlearning and robotics uh so nice to meet\nyou\nyeah that was div for since he didn't\nsay his name\nchaitanya if you want to introduce\nyourself\nyeah uh hi everyone my name is chaitanya\nand i'm currently working as an ml\nengineer at a startup uh called move\nworks before that i was a master student\nat stanford specializing in nlp and was\na member of the prize filling stanford's\nteam for the alexa price challenge\nright awesome\nso\nmoving on to the\nrest of this talk\nessentially\nwhat we hope you will learn watching\nthese videos\nand what we hope uh\nthe people who took our class in the\nfall of 2021 learned\nis three things\none is we hope you will have an\nunderstanding of how transformers work\nsecondly we hope you will\nlearn and by the end of these talks\nunderstand how transformers are being\napplied beyond just natural language\nprocessing\nand thirdly we hope that some of these\ntalks will\nspark some new ideas within you\nand hopefully lead to new directions of\nresearch new kinds of innovation and\nthings of that sort\nand\nto begin we're going to talk a little\nbit\nabout transformers and introduce some of\nthe context behind transformers as well\nand for that i'd like to hand it off to\ndiv\nso hi everyone\num so welcome to our transformer seminar\nuh so i will start first with an\noverview of the attention timeline uh\nand how it came to be uh the the key\nidea about transformers was the\nself-potential mechanism uh that was\ndeveloped in 2017 and this all started\nwith this one paper called retention is\nall you need i was on youtube uh before\n2017 we used to have this prehistoric\nera where we had uh older models like\nrnns lstms and uh simpler attention\nmechanisms and eventually like the\ngrowth in transformers has exploded into\nother fields and has become prominent in\nlike\nall of machine learning and uh i'll go\nand see and show how this has been used\nso in the prehistoric era there used to\nbe rnns\nthere were different models like the\nsequencer sequence lstms gius\nthey were good at encoding um some sort\nof memory but they did not work for\nencoding long sequences and they were\nvery bad at encoding context so here is\nan example where you if you have a\nsentence like i grew up in france dot\ndot dot so i speak fluent dash then you\nwant to fill this with like a french\nbased on the context but like a lsd\nmodel might not know what it is and\nmight just make a very big mistake here\nsimilarly we can show some sort of\ncorrelation map uh here where if we have\na pronoun like it we wanted to correlate\nto one of the past nouns that we have\nseen so far like a animal\num but again uh older models were like\nreally not good at this context encoding\nso where we are currently now is on the\nverge of takeoff we've begun to realize\nthe potential of transformers in\ndifferent fields we have started to use\nthem to solve long sequence problems in\nprotein folding such as like the alpha\npole model from gp from open from\ndeepmind\nwhich gets 95 percent accuracy on\ndifferent challenges in offline rl uh we\ncan use it for few shot and zero\nstructuralization for text and image\ngeneration and we can also use this for\nlike content generation so here is\nexample from openai where you can give a\ndifferent text prompt and\nhave an ai generator fictional image for\nyou\nand uh so there's a\ntalk on this that you can also watch in\nyoutube which basically says that ls\nstudents are dead and long-lived\ntransformers\nso what's the future\nso\nwe can enable a lot more applications\nfor transformers um they can be applied\nto any form of sequence modeling so you\ncan use we could use them for video\nunderstanding we can use them for\nfinance and a lot more so basically\nimagine all sorts of genetic modeling\nproblems\nnevertheless there are a lot of missing\ningredients so like the human brain we\nneed some sort of external memory\nunit which is the hippocampus for us and\nthey are saying some early works here so\none nice work you might want to check\nout is called this neural tuning\nmachines\nsimilarly uh the current attention\nmechanisms are very computationally\ncomplex in terms of time and they scale\ncorrectly which we will discuss later\nand we want to make them more linear and\nthe third problem is that we want to\nalign our current sort of language\nmodels with the how the human brain\nworks and human values and this also big\nissue\nokay so now i will deep dive deep dive i\nwill\ndive deeper into the tension mechanisms\nand uh show how they came out to be\nso\ninitially there used to be very simple\nmechanisms um where attention was\ninspired by the process of importance\nreading or putting attention on\ndifferent parts of uh\nimage where like similar to a human\nwhere you might focus more on like a\nforeground uh if you have an image of a\ndog compared to like the rest of the\nbackground\nso in the case of soft retention what\nyou do is you learn this simple soft\nattention weighting for each pixel which\ncan be a weight between zero to one uh\nthe problem over here is that this is a\nvery expensive computation and then you\ncan as show as as it's shown in the\nfigure on the left uh you can see we are\ncalculating this attention for the whole\nimage um\nwhat you can

less\ncomputation expensive but the problem is\nit's non-differentiable and makes things\nharder to drain\nuh going forwards we also have different\nvarieties of basic attention mechanisms\nthat came that were proposed before\nself-retention\nuh so the first\nvariety here is global tension models so\nin global attention models for each\nhidden\nlayer input a hidden layer output you\nlearn an attention weight uh a of b\nand this is element twice multiplied\nwith your current output to calculate\nyour final output uh yt\num similarly you have local attention\nmodels where instead of calculating the\nglobal attention for over the whole\nsequence length you only calculate the\nattention over a small window\nand uh and then you wait by the tension\nof the window in into like the current\noutput uh to get like the final output\nuh so moving on uh i will pass on to\nchattanooga to discuss self-retention\nmechanisms and transforms\nyeah uh thank you this for covering a\nbrief overview of how the\nprimitive versions of attention work\nnow just before we talk about\nself-attention uh just a bit of a trivia\nthat this term was first introduced by a\npaper which from line it

norm after this\nand lastly there are residual\nconnections between different encoder\nblocks\nthe decoder is very similar to the\nencoder but there's one difference which\nis that it has this extra layer because\nthe decoder doesn't just do multi-head\nattention on the output of the previous\nlayers so so for context the encoder\ndoes multi-head attention\nso each\nself-retention layer in the encoder\nblock\nin each of the encoder blocks does\nmulti-head attention looking at the\nprevious\nlayers of the encoder blocks the decoder\nhowever does\nthat in the sense that it also looks at\nthe previous layers of the decoder but\nit also looks at the output of the\nencoder and so it needs us a multi-head\nattention layer over the encoder blocks\nand lastly there's masking as well um so\nif you are because every token can look\nat every other token um you want to sort\nof make sure in the decoder that you're\nnot looking into the future so if you're\nin position three for instance you\nshouldn't be able to look at position\nfour and position five\nso those are sort of all the components\nthat led to the creation of the model in\num the vasani idol paper\nand\num let's talk a little bit about the\nadvantages and drawbacks of this model\num so the two main advantages which are\nhuge advantages and which are why\ntransformers have done such a good job\nof\nrevolutionizing\nmany many fields within deep learning\num are as follows so so the first is\nthere is this constant path length\nbetween any two positions in a sequence\nbecause every\ntoken in the sequence is looking at\nevery other token\nand this basically solves the problem\nthat they've talked about earlier with\nlong sequences you don't have this\nproblem with long sequences where if\nyou're trying to predict a token that\ndepends on a word\nthat was far far behind in a sentence\nyou don't have the problem of losing\nthat context now the distance between\nthem is only\none in terms of the path length\nalso because the nature of the\ncomputation that's happening transformer\nmodels lend themselves really well to\nparallelization and because of the\nadvances that we've had with gpus\nbasically if you take a transfer model\nwith n parameters and you take a model\nthat isn't a transformer say like i can\nhave stm with also with n parameters\ntraining the transformer model is going\nto be much faster because of the\nparallelization that it leverages\nso those are the advantages\nthe disadvantages are basically\nself-attention takes quadratic time\nbecause every token looks at every other\ntoken order n square as you might know\ndoes not scale and there's actually been\na lot of work in trying to tackle this\nso we've linked to some here big bird\nlin former and reformer are all\napproaches to try and make this linear\nor quasi-linear essentially\nand\nyeah we highly recommend to\nrecommend going through jay alamer's\nblog the illustrated transformer which\nprovides great visualizations and\nexplains everything that we just talked\nabout in great detail\nyeah and i'd like to pass it on to\nchaitanya for applications of\ntransformers\nyeah so now moving on to like some of\nthe recent work uh some of the work that\nuh very shortly followed the\ntransformers paper\nso one of the models that came out uh\nwas gpt the gbt architecture which was\nreleased by open eyes so uh so open ei\nhad the latest model that opened here\nhas in the gpt series is the gpd3 so it\nconsists of only the decoder blocks from\ntransformers and is trained on our\ntraditional language modeling task which\nis uh predicting the current token which\nis separating the next token given the\nlast uh t tokens that that the model has\nseen\nand for any downstream tasks now the\nmodel can just you can just train a\nclassification layer on the last hidden\nstate\nwhich can be\nwhich can have any number of labels and\nsince the model is generative in nature\nyou can also use the pre-trained network\nas uh for generative kind of tasks such\nas summarization and natural language\nand natural language generation\nfor things for that instance\nanother important aspect that gpt 3\ngained popularity was its ability to\nto be able to perform in context\nlearning what the authors called into\ncontext learning so this is the ability\nwherein the model can perform can learn\nunder few short settings uh what what\nthe task is to complete the task without\nperforming any gradient updates for\nexample let's say the model is shown\na bunch of addition examples and then if\nyou pass in a new uh input and leave the\nuh and just leave it at uh at equal to\nsign the model tries to predict the act\nnext token uh which very well comes out\nto be the sum of the uh the sum of the\nnumbers that's that is shown another\nexample can be also the spell correction\ntask or the translation task so this is\nthis was the ability that uh made gpt 3\nso much uh uh talked about in the nlp\nworld and uh right now also like many\napplications have been made using gp3\nwhich includes uh the\none of them being the vs code co-pilot\nwhich uh tries to\nwhich tries to generate a piece of code\ngiven our doctrine kind of natural\nlanguage text\nanother major uh model that came out\nthat was based on the transformers\narchitecture was bird so but uh lends\nits name from it's an acronym for\nbi-directional encoding encoder\nrepresentations of transformers\nit consists of uh only the encoder\nblocks of the transformers which is\nunlike gpd3 which had only the decoder\nblocks\nnow this prop because of this change\nthere there comes a problem because\nuh because bert has only the encoder\nblock so it sees the entire piece of\ntext it cannot be pre-trained on a live\nlanguage modeling task because of the\nproblem of data leakage from the future\nso what the authors came up with was a\nclever idea and they uh and they came up\nwith a novel task called mass language\nmodeling which was uh which included to\nreplace certain birds with a placeholder\nand then the model tries to predict\nthose words given the entire context\nnow apart from this token level task\nthere was the authors also added a\nsecond objective called the next\nsentence prediction which was a sentence\nlevel task\nwherein given two chunks of text\nthe model tried to predict whether the\nsecond sentence followed the other\nsentence or not follow the first\nsentence or not\nand now for after pre-training this\nmodel for any downstream task the model\ncan be further fine-tuned with an\nadditional classification layer just\nlike it was in chip e3\nso ah these are the two models that were\nthat have been like very popular and\nhave made a lot of applications made\ntheir way in lot of applications but the\nlandscape has changed quite a lot since\nwe have taken this class there are\nmodels with different pre-training\ntechniques like elektra d berta and\nthere are also models that do\nwell in like other modalities and which\nwe're going to be talking about in other\nlecture series as well\nso yeah that's all from this lecture and\nthank you for tuning in\nyeah um just want to just want to end by\nsaying thank you all for watching this\nand we have a really exciting set of\nvideos with truly amazing speakers and\nwe hope you are able to derive value\nfrom that\nthanks a lot thank you thank you\neveryone\nyou",

    "transcript": "well hey everyone this is shirish and\nwelcome back to my channel but today I'm\nback with another one of the amazing\nuniversities University of Maryland at\nCollege Park or U Maryland okay so I\nhave something very interesting to share\nwith you I have created an amazing\nProfile assessment and it is completely\nfree to use yes just head to the link\nmentioned in the description box and get\nyour profile evaluated for free on what\nkind of universities you can get into it\nis the most comprehensive profile\nevaluation that my team has created and\nit includes a lot of different factors\nand gives you extraordinary insights\ninto what steps you must take to build\nyour profile to get admission to your\ndream University well it's really the\nmost informative profile assessments\navailable anywhere all you need to do is\ntake out 10 minutes fill the objective\ntype questionnaire and your results will\nbe emailed to you in no time make sure\nto check your spam folder as well and\nenjoy your personal assessment and\naction steps on how to get admission to\nyour dream College admission\nand if you need any help after that my\nteam and I are always there to help you\nwith your entire College admission\nJourney because I'm not just a YouTuber\nI'm an entrepreneur helping thousands of\nstudents every year from past 12 years\nso yes we have the best knowledge and\nstrategies for you but not for this\nvideo I have received a ton of requests\nto review this University so let's hit\nit up for University of Maryland at\nCollege Park\n[Music]\nhi I'm sharesh Gupta and I Empower\npeople to hack their success rise above\nthe challenges and confidently create an\nextraordinary life they deserve\nUniversity of Maryland is a public land\nground research University in College\nPark Maryland it was founded in 1856 in\nthe University system of Maryland it is\nclassified among R1 which is doctoral\nuniversities which means very high\nresearch activities and is labeled as\npublic IV yes denoting the quality of\nEducation comparable to private IV\nUniversity of Maryland is part of Big\nTen Conference for intercollegit\nAesthetics and is a big deal in division\n1 Sports within the group itself\nthe main campus is located in College\nPark a city in Maryland it is\napproximately four miles from the\nNortheast border of Washington DC it is\na Suburban location and has much more to\noffer on top of its proximity to\nWashington DC you will find enough\nactivities for yourself to keep you busy\nall throughout the year merrylands 1340\nacre College Park campus Embraces an\narray of architectural styles that\ninclude the Georgian brick building with\nthe Oak Lane mall at the heart of the\ncampus the university is improving every\nyear on the front of making the campus a\nmore sustainable and environment\nfriendly the Irby Center for computer\nscience featuring six floors of\nspecialized high-tech labs and the Saint\nJohn teaching and learning center are\namong the recent additions to the\nMaryland campus all colleges at the\ncampus are equipped with\nstate-of-the-art facilities the most\npopular majors at University of Maryland\ninclude biological sciences economics\nmechanical engineering Finance\ncriminology and criminal justice\ncomputer science business and journalism\nwell although I'm not a big fan of\njudging the university solely on the\nbasis of the ranking but University of\nMaryland is consistently placed into top\n100 National ranked universities as well\nas globally have some of its amazing\ncourses all right now let's move on to\nour next section talking about the right\nfit starting with academic fit\nwell academics at University of Maryland\nare amazing Maryland's coursework is\nintense but more collaborative than\ncompetitive its 12 colleges offer about\n200 degree granting programs including\n90 to undergraduate 107 Masters program\nor about 83 doctoral programs and also\nstudents are allowed to combine\nestablished Majors to create their own\ndesign programs which is awesome\nMaryland has earned a strong reputation\nfor its engineering and computer science\nprograms as well as the Smith School of\nBusiness and Middle College of\nJournalism the psychology and biological\nsciences programs have gained a lot of\nreputation in recent years as well\nMaryland's location comes with a ton of\nopportunities its proximity to the\nnational capital has resulted in many\ndefense research projects available on\ncampus funded by none other than NASA\nHomeland Security National Institute of\nHealth the UMD fire which is first year\nInnovation research experience program\nallows qualified freshmen to join\nfaculty-led research groups for research\nand mentorship experiences a lot of\nresearchers available for graduate\nstudents as well internship\nopportunities nearby DC area in\nBaltimore are available in plenty and a\ntwo-day orientation seminars and course\nclusters are offered for many programs\naround 60 of undergrad opposed graduate\nstudents participate in more than 20\nliving learning programs that provide\nexperiential learning opportunities in\nmore intimate settings\nthere are a lot of study abroad programs\nas well for students that can take\nadvantage of around 22 percent shouldn't\nstudy abroad in thousands of countries\nlike Costa Rica Israel Sweden and others\nthey're available for international\nstudents as well\nThe Faculty at University of Maryland\nare extremely detail-oriented and\nMasters in their fields the quality of\nteaching here has been pretty good\nfaculty members are accessible lower\nlevel courses tend to be large and\nimpersonal but the corresponding weekly\ndiscussion sections led by the teaching\nassistants of a personal attention to\nthose who need it the class size at\nUniversity of Maryland is large to\naverage most of the lower level classes\nare about 100 to 200 students and\nfollows the tutorial group format but\nthe situation improves when you get into\nhigher classes which is lesson number so\nkeeping all this thing in mind I would\nlike to rate University of Maryland with\nfour stars on academic difficulty and\nquality level if five is the highest\nlevel well after accurate fit let's move\nto social fit\nwell social life in Maryland is epic\nstudents enjoy frequent School sponsored\nconcerts movies as well as the\ntraditional fraternities parties Art\nAttack is a favorite annual event in\nwhich local artists share their crafts\nand National touring artists perform an\nevening concert other popular events\ninclude Maryland day and homecoming with\nover 800 clubs and different student\norganizations at Maryland students will\nalways be able to find their niche many\nclubs are available for you to invest\nyour time in including an independent\nstudent newspaper non-commercial radio\nand a national level competing acapella\ngroups\nMaryland has a huge area of community\nand volunteer services that can connect\nyou with local and National\norganizations for Elder Care tutoring\nmentoring and environmental action\nUniversity of Maryland is about 42 000\nstudents about 30 000 as undergrad and\nremaining is pgs and phds the university\nhas about 70 percent in State student\nand rest are out of state including 12\nstudent body as International students\nhousing is good enough for most students\nthere are single gender and co-ed\nhousing available for all only 40 of\nstudents stay on campus if freshmen are\nguaranteed housing upperclassmen have\nthe option of on-campus apartments and\nSuites while many Juniors and seniors\nseek off-campus accommodation as well\navailability of residence hall space is\nvery limited for graduate students all\nrequests are initially placed on a\nwaiting list if space becomes available\ngraduate students are moved off the\nwaiting list and assigned a room\nenrollment so if you're applying for\ngraduate make sure to factor in that\nthe campus is also known for good food\nin all three Campus Dining Halls apart\nfrom the housing meal options for\nstudents staying on campus a lot of\non-campus and off-campus food beverage\noptions are available the quality and\nvariety are good as well University of\nMaryland is big on Sports as well like I\nsaid earlier part of Big Ten division\none and all a handful of intramurals and\n45 Club Level Sports draw roughly a\nthird of the stones men's and women's\nlacros are National powerhouses and\nmen's soccer women's basketball and\nfield hockey are recent conference\nChamps football is pretty famous here as\nwell University of Maryland offers\ncompetitive academics and good social\nlife as well so I'd like to give it five\nstars out of five on quality of life at\nUniversity of Maryland but now let's\nmove on to financial fit\nUniversity of Maryland Falls in an\naffordable School category the\nexpenditure is about 35 to 40 000 US\ndollars in annual tuition expenses\nwithout scholarships housing and dining\nis about 13 000 to about 16 000 US\nDollars range for the most as soon as\nfinancial aid is concerned the\nuniversity has a lot of scholarship\noptions deserving and qualified students\nreceive a merit award of a part seven\nthousand dollars and athletes can take\nadvantage of about 400 different\nScholarships in 19 different sports\noverall I will give it four stars out of\nfive on financial fit well after\nexploring the fit let's move to the most\ncurious section on how to Triple your\nchance of getting into University of\nMaryland with my special admission tips\nand strategies the ideas I'm going to\nshare now come from a decade-long\nexperience working with students and\ncareer for College admission through my\ncompany and helping a lot of students\nget admission to their dream colleges\nas far as admissions are concerned\nUniversity Maryland follows a holistic\napproach University of Maryland is one\nof the top colleges in the U.S and the\nworld the acceptance rate last year was\nabout 51 overall but a bit lower for\ninternational students so when it comes\nto the international student University\nof Maryland is extremely selective to\nmake sure to factor in that\nan online application with official\ntranscripts standardized course like sat\nact Greg mat a levels and two letter of\nrecommendations are required for\ncompleting your application and along\nwith your course Scholastic activities\nalso where a community involvement the\nArts Sports work experience research\nopportunities family involvement or\nother activities and hobbies you should\nshare only what has been particularly\nmeaning to you\nalong with your GPA test course\nUniversity of Maryland also looks for\nacademic Endeavors outside of your\nclassroom that means what have you done\nto pursue your academic interests\noutside of your class\nUniversity of Maryland looks for breadth\nof life experiences and this can be\nshown through the activities you have\nparticipated in make sure to highlight\nbreadth in your profile or diversity in\nyour profile now I have discussed in\nsome I really colleges that they look\nfor depth in your profile university of\nIreland looks for breadth in your\nprofile which is great because most\nstudents they have it make sure to talk\nabout this in your application so of\ncourse your extracurricular activities\nand any recognition of special\nachievements are important in your\napplication make sure to include this\nthe most important segment of\napplication is always the university\nessays the university looks for written\nexpression of ideas through your essays\nthat is how well you can express your\nideas and that must come through your\nessays or statement of purpose\nUniversity of Maryland have smaller\nsupplement essays for most programs it\nprovides you with the opportunity to\ntell the admission committee more about\nyour personality and experiences so make\nsure to talk about that\nyou Maryland also looks for two things\nin your profile Community involvement or\ncommunity service and demonstrated\nleadership both are super important for\nadmission so participate in community\nservice and take on leadership roles and\nmake sure to mention both in your\napplications\nthe um Maryland also requires all\nInternational students to present\nEnglish proficiency all undergraduate or\npostgraduate programs require a specific\nminimum score for admission ranging\nanything about 80 200 TOEFL score and\nequivalent in other exams like IELTS\nalumni interviews are an optional\ncomponent of the application process\navailable on a limited basis and mostly\nto postgraduate and doctoral students\nfor doctoral applicants committee\ninterviews are something that can be\nexpected during admissions\nas for the deadlines for admission you\nmayilen offers two deadlines for\nundergraduate students that is early\naction which is only November 1st and\nthen the regular decision which is about\nJanuary\nfor all postgraduate courses they have\nindividual Department deadlines with\neither one or two deadlines between\nSeptember to March every year but\npredominantly December January is a most\nactive time\ntransfer applicants are welcomed as well\ndepending upon the availability with\napplication accepted between November to\nMarch depending upon the course as well\nin the end to conclude if you are a\nperson with diversity enjoy working hard\nalong with fun loving research-oriented\nbackground you merryland is for you\n[Music]\nwell thank you so much for watching this\nvideo really appreciate it please make\nsure to support my work by liking and\nsharing this video and also subscribe to\nmy channel and hit that Bell icon\nremember to complete your profile\nevaluation as discussed in the beginning\nof this video and get your personalized\nreport for free in fact a lot of\nstudents and parents tell me that the\nreport is so good they would have paid\nfor it but it's free for you so yeah\nit's one tool that will help you in your\nCollege admission journey and I'm here\nwith you to support you on this\nbeautiful Journey if you need any\nassistance me and my team are always\nhere to help you thank you once again\nand I'll be back with another amazing\nvideo for you till then this is Sharif\nsigning off take care bye-bye have

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzk9qK8tqXE",
    "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to today's video so\nfirst and foremost I hope that you are\nmaking good money in the stock market if\nyou have been following this channel for\nthe last two years you guys know that I\nstarted buying quite aggressively when\nthe market was roughly around 17 17 and\na half\nth000 in fact last one year had been\nextremely bullish on small mid gaps\nthey've all given roughly 40% run UPF\nthat was Phase 1 okay now starts phase\ntwo where I have restarted my buying I\nfeel that good money is to be made in\nthe next 6 to 12 months so I'm buying a\nlot of things for example today I bought\nall this stuff so on this video I'm\ngoing to do two three things number one\nI'm going to help you understand why the\nmarkets are likely to give a breakout in\nthe next 6 to 12 months run up B where\nwill that runup be and more importantly\nwhat type of lowrisk high risk medium\nrisk opportunities you can explore\nquestion\nHDFC all this that's a lowrisk\nopportunity if you want to x 3X your\nmoney then you have to go to another\ncategory of Investments so I'm going to\nexplain all these different categories\nmy humble request is very simple that\nplease watch the macro part of this\nvideo which is part one understand the\nlogic without understanding the logic if\nstock then you will start trembling\nright so please do not fall into that\ntrap if you are from that category\nplease stop watching my channel go away\nso that's point one then watch the\nsecond half of the video where I will\nrelate this macroeconomics to specific\nstock stocks so yes stock specific\ndiscussion so let's begin and just a\nvery quick\nnote so that these type of videos reach\nout to more people second let me also\ntell you one important thing that all of\nus are very very interested in terms of\nmaking money in the stock market market\nbut at the same time we should be\nequally considerate in terms of\nincreasing our earning potential now one\nway of doing that is to learn trending\nskills especially the skills that are\ngoing to create a massive impact on the\nfuture so as Per a recent study which\nwas done by World economic Forum\napproximately 85 million people are\ngoing to lose jobs due to AI or\nartificial intelligence it is going to\nhave a massive impact on the world so\nsay narrative that we have to pick AI\nrelated skills now one great way an\nabsolutely free way of learning about AI\nis to attend the workshop by growth\nschool who are the partners of today's\nvideo they are running a workshop and if\nyou are watching this video you can\nattend this workshop for free it's\navailable to viewers who will use the\nlink in the description and comment box\nto sign up for the workshop so for you\nguys it will be absolutely free of cost\nplease remember that it is only\napplicable to First 1,000 participants\nwho are signing up using the link in the\ndescription and comment box the first\n1,000 people to sign up will get a bonus\nworth 2,000 rupe for free usually this\nis a paid Workshop but this has been\nmade free for my viewers now on this\nWorkshop you will learn a series of\ntools and techniques related to\nartificial intelligence and chat GPT so\nirrespective of whichever industry you\ncome from be it freelance ing be Finance\nbe Tech this Workshop is going to be\nhyper useful for you this has been\nattended by more than 1 million students\nall across the globe who have derived\ntremendous value from this workshop and\nyou can do the same so I highly\nrecommend you to register for this\nworkshop and start learning more about\nAI so on that note let me jump right\ninto the video and help you understand\nthe difference between lowrisk mid- risk\nand highrisk investment opportunities in\nthe market right now see if the market\nitself Falls so right now we are\nsomewhere around 22,000\nnow if the market Falls to somewhere\naround let's say 20,000\nso most likely almost 90 95% of the\nstocks are going to crash why because\nthis is an entire Market correction\nso that are you bullish about the market\nare you thinking that market is going to\ngo sideways or are you bearish about the\nmarket so clity then you should not\ninvest you should stay on the sidelines\nwatch the show a little bit when you get\nthe confidence of invest think you know\n6 to 12 months markets are going to give\na run up then you come and invest okay\nso that is a very basic common sensical\npoint but this perspective needs to be\nfor at least 6 to 12 months you cannot\njust go and you know video I'm shooting\nthis video on like\nThursday and then you start trembling no\nyou are working with the Assumption what\nis going to happen in the market in 6 to\n12 months time okay this is very very\nimportant Point most of us miss that so\non that note you need to have a\nhypothesis of investing 6 to 12 months\nso here is my one minute quick summary\non this topic see before elections or\naround elections there is a lot of\nvolatility in the market volatility\nMarket is this happening yes number two\npoint that during this volatile phase\nyou should look at mini phases when\ninvestors are not very enthusiastic\nabout the market there is a little bit\nof mongering\nHappening by using something called as\nMarket mood index for example Market\nmood index it shows the collective\nsentiment in the absolute short-term\nbasis so you can see that this is in the\nfear Zone in fact extreme fear so that\nwas again from a short-term perspective\nwas a good time to buy so to say okay so\nif you are able to explore these type of\nmini phases then that definitely becomes\na good time to invest final point that\nyou must understand something called as\nmacro triggers I've been saying it\nrepeatedly over the last month I'll\nagain say it see macro\ntriggers something from macroeconomics\npoint of view is going to favor the\nstock market and that according to me is\nsomething called as interest rate Cuts\nokay right now the interest rates in the\nUS market is effectively somewhere\naround 6% they are likely to be brought\ndown to 3%\nnow\n6%% now how soon that is the only thing\nthat people are\ndebating interest rate cut and you know\nmarket then the news came out and a lot\nof confusion is going on right now that\nis probably the best time to play this\ntheme right and therefore I investing\nmore and more in the market as of now\nover the next 10 15 days I'm going to\ninvest very heavily whenever I see a\nmarket correction May we are going to\nbuy big big and sit tight and wait for\nthese interest rate to get cut now a lot\nof counter responses will come you know\nwhat akat interest rates might take a\nyear to play out yes definitely but what\nwe are more concerned about is factoring\nof interest rate now what is the meaning\nof factoring of interest\nrate interest rate now that is not some\nhidden news of course interest rates are\ngoing to get cut the confusion is\naround right now when almost everyone's\nmind is made up you know what boss now\ninterest rates are definitely going to\nget cut that means that the market has\nabsorbed this information\nand so right now in the market when we\nare sitting in mid of Feb 202 for this\nClarity on when the interest rates are\ngoing to get cut is not there okay\neveryone understands that interest rate\nis going to get cut so from that note if\nyou want to benefit from this theme it\nis not a bad time to invest playing this\ntheme right now in the market confusion\nthis Clarity will emerge over the next 1\nto two months and therefore I feel that\nthere will be a mini rally because of\nthis so I hope that this point is clear\nthen comes the second key\naspect okay it really depends on your\nrisk appetite for example if you want to\nbuy lowrisk stuff then go to mutual\nfunds what type of mutual funds for\nexample up\nsmall the chances of Correction Still\nRemains high so what you should rather\ndo is that go with something like hybrid\nso that is a better option and a\nslightly more safer option if you go to\nstocks like HDFC bank or kch bank\nis highest ever profits highest ever\nrevenues is one of the lowest so from\nthat note this will be considered as a\nlowrisk opportunity because the chances\nof fall in either of these segments is\nnot more than like\n15% okay so this is very reasonable so\nto say now what are mid risk\nopportunities now if you start playing\naround with individual small cap midcap\nstocks these would be considered in the\nmid to highrisk categories if you go to\nmicro cap now in a growing environment\ngrowing business environment when the\ninterest rates will be cut there will be\na rally or there is very high chances\nthat small and midgap companies are\ngoing to Rally a lot by using specific\nexamples but to cut the long story short\nin a good business environment or in an\nenvironment where interest rates are low\nmidcaps small caps micro caps are all\ngoing to Rally they are going to double\ntriple 5x 6X in their size so on that\nnote these are mid- risk and high-risk\nopportunities\nbecause market then of course these\nthings have the potential to rise also\nbut at the same time they have massive\nchances of Correction also so therefore\nthese would be categorized as mid to\nhighrisk Opportunities so you need to be\nvery clear which bucket you are trying\nto pick so I hope that this first part\nis clear to everyone that what is the\nmacro theme playing out now let me use\nspecific examples and go into specific\nstocks so let us go asset and stockwise\nand let us start tagging every\nopportunity as mid low high risk and I\nwill also potentially talk about how\nmuch money can you make from this\nopportunity of course these are my\nestimates they can of course be off but\nat least it will give you one side of\nthe entire equation and cont Viewpoint\nand make up your own mind so let's begin\nand the first key thing that you will\nsee from this chart is that I have sold\nmy it index 50% of it and I have\nreinvested that money into something\nlike Bank Nifty or Bank bees which is\nthe bank\nindex and what type of opportunity is\nthis well this is a lowrisk opportunity\nwhy because index to\nfor\nexamp\nmonths that was the time that I\npurchased it index I made like 36 37%\ngains in 6 seven months on it\nindex now I have done profit booking on\nit I did not run behind TCS and infosis\nand all these midgap it companies this\nthat because the way you need to think\nis or the I was actually thinking was if\nyou are able to pick like a low risk\nopportunity you are able to put big\nmoney behind that there is a huge\ndifference in investing 5 lakhs on a\nmidcap\nopportunity right but on the flip side\nif you invest let's say 2 cres and if\nyou\nimag you invest 2 cres and you get like\n35 36% gain absolute profit to 7 lakhs\nin that 6 months so Quantum of money is\nalso important aspect to consider and\nwhen you are putting very big money you\nhave to be considerate about the risk so\npicking those low risk opportunity makes\nsense so back to\ntopic I have sold 50% of it index and\nrotated that Capital to bank\nindex so okay so this was a chart that I\nwas showing right when I started buying\nit index so I had purchased it somewhere\nhere right\nand\n36% it was moving in this channel so I\ncategorically said\nthis is likely to move in this range\nright unless the market you know it\ngives a decisive breakout and creates\nanother channel so this can still very\nwell fundamentally speaking I do not\nsee but I feel that companies like TCS\ninfosis are now at a fair PE\nvalue there are fundamental issues in it\nIndustries still\nvaluation has actually increased now why\nthe valuation has increased because it\nhas already given 36% run up so there\nfor booking profits made a lot of sense\nto\nme okay now use little bit of brein so\nfirst and foremost thing up top Nifty\nbank so this is the bank index it is\nright now trading 5% from its stock okay\nso there is a little bit of margin of\nsafety so to say by 5% discount with the\nm\nright right so that's point one point\ntwo if you check the valuation and\npre so from pre-o Level it has been\nalmost four years so in four years it\nhas given 45% run up\nso on Bank index now maybe is a slow\ngrowth IND\nso\nokay so for example if you check private\nbank right so let's pick HDFC which is\nmy favorite bank so alltime high profits\nalltime High revenues\nso it has doubled its Revenue it has\ndoubled its profit and how much has the\nstock price moved so if you go to HDFC\nBank the stock price has not moved at\nall right so it is here,\n1446 and preo preo it was like 1300 so\nhardly any growth has happened same has\nhappened with kch bank same has happened\nwith SBI same has happened with a bunch\nof other stocks so public sector Bank\nprivate sector bankal not too many banks\nhave given a run up barring a few PSU\nBanks so to say okay corporate Banks May\ntop tier Blue Chip large cap corporate\nBanks it is clearly undervalued right so\nthat is what I will simply say it is a\nlowrisk opportunity\nwhatever profits I'm making I'm happy\nputting it not a problem I okay holding\nit I have confidence on my analysis and\nI will\nput I can help you understand the\nrational then it is your call okay now\nsee why am I calling stocks like HDFC\nBank cotch Bank as safe stocks because\nsee there is a very clear industry\ngrowth that is there in banking there is\nvery clear growth in their assets for\nexample balance sheet strong for example\nreses which is company's own money that\nitself has doubled over the last four\nyears so why is it that the stock will\nnot give\nup for example just use your brain HDFC\nBank despite having such high revenues\nprofits how has the stock price being\nkept low this is a very interesting\nquestion to explore to is see sometimes\nwhat ends up happening is PE contraction\ncontraction PE G so if PE contraction of\na stock happens then despite the\ncompanies giving very high earnings\nprofits revenues whatever good good\nnumbers you look at the stock price will\nnot move the stock price might in fact\nfall now can this be permanently done\nthe short answer is no and for example\nif you go on the PE\ntab in average of something like HDFC\nbank is around 20\nright now it is at 15 PE so p is almost\nright P has been made half okay now PE\nis a game of sentiments right so\nsentiment so the same industry for\nexample right and the same\nindustry now the company has done\neverything well right there is nothing\noff in a high interest rate environment\nthe Nim is going to go low it's as\nsimple as that the provisioning\nrequirements will be High\nnew right by\nbig people start\npcking the stock is solid it's gold from\nthat perspective I see no problem in\nterms of buying Bank bees or or save\nthings like HDFC Bank\ncounter it did not move despite it\nposting very good\nprofit for example if you take this\nphase right so for example 2013 all the\nway till 2019\nand 2022 it gave almost 0% run up okay\n2013 say 2022 0% run up and then if you\nwould have bought it somewhere here\nright in this Zone and held it somewhere\nhere you would have made a lot of money\ngo and check akas ITC you would see me\nbuying it in this range only I could not\nmake 100% profits on ITC but I made like\ngood 60 70% profit on ITC in a very\nshort span of time so was very happy\nwith that\npurchase for that you need to again go\nback and check and profit numbers so for\nexample take a look from this phase 2012\nsay 2022 right\ndoubling\nfor\n201 right in 2022 right Revenue right so\n31 say 60 from here to here 2022 again\ndouble right so\nHD\nAndes right so therefore it's unlikely\nthat HDFC will behave the way ITC had\nbehaved ITC doubling profit revenues key\nin 10 years in HDFC it doubled in 4\nyears now this is not just HDFC story\nnow this is the same story for a bunch\nof private banks in India now on that\nnote let me give a very quick snippet on\na public sector bank which I had been\nbullish about I had been buying i' had\nbeen talking about it consistently on my\nYouTube member Community also again I\nwould request all of you to join it it's\na very useful Community I give very\nquick updates I cannot make videos\nreally fast but what Market updates are\nhappening I can summarize it and present\nit in a sensible manner which you can\neasily absorb so join the link is in the\ndescription and comment box it will give\nyou very interesting commentary it will\nincrease your confidence in investing\nI've spoken about SBI multiple times\nthere and i' had shown you all the\nlevels\nso so on SBI I had made a video a few\ndays earlier and I had said that we are\nlikely to see a very quick 16% gain\nright and again if you just go and check\nthe fundamental data on SBI again the\nsame stuff right I mean there is nothing\nlike you know off happening on SBI\nright for example PR analysis SBI is at\na p of 9.88 Punjab National Bank just\nmay which I have sold I rotated that\nCapital to SBI and SBI me now I'm\nsitting on roughly 26 27% profit since\nthe time I've bought it\npnb 19 SBI is working at half that P so\nwhy is it that SBI P will not rise or\nopposite could happen that pnv P follow\nso in either of these scenarios if\nyou're bullish on the banking industry\nthen you need to have these type of\nstocks in your portfolio these are\nlowrisk assets now why am I calling this\nlow risk asset because baring a very\nminute chance\nunder General circumstances General\neconomic conditions it is very very\nunlikely that these type of stocks will\ncorrect by more than 15 20% unless you\nare buying them at very high valuation\nthis is the most important point for\nexample National Bank so now it is\nalready at 19p right and its pers are at\nlike 910p so because you are buying\nPunjab National Bank at very high\nvaluation the chances are that it might\nhappen that\nit just stops right it just keeps on\ngoing sideways and it becomes a problem\nfor\nyouc and that to for a company which is\ngenerating very high revenues very high\nprofits so I hope that this story is\nclear where do I see HDFC bank and SBI\ngoing from this point if I have to give\nyou some numbers I definitely do see\nHDFC Bank giving a 30% odd gager over\nthe next 2 to 3 years 30\n30% something around 20 25% K is\nsomething that I'm expecting on SBI how\nam I reaching those numbers so tomorrow\nI will try to write a post on community\nmembership so low risk\nassets risk\nasss and there are four specific things\nthat you need to keep in mind the first\nis\nthat for example something is happening\nright now in Pharma something is\nhappening in chemical\nconsumer durables so these are all pity\nP Industries for what reason they got\npity that's an entirely different\nconversation but right\nnow you will clearly seea chemical\nconsumer\ndurabl industry similarly private sector\nbanks are also P industry so in this\nturnaround chances are very very high\noppos for example right real stocks\nOPP that's a simple Point okay so this\nis one second is that in those specific\ncompanies that you are touching the\nnumbers or the profit revenues growth\nrate should be fairly High okay the\nvaluation from a PE point of view should\nnot be very high because when you are\ntrying to buy risky stocks what is it\nthat you are trying to do well you are\ntrying to probably pick bets that can go\n3x 5x in the next 3 years\nso so that's a problem so therefore you\nhave to buy when companies are at lower\nPE finally the size of the company\nshould be small for\nexample for example Gio Finance now\nmarket cap of the company itself is very\nbig so Gio Finance is a very good 2x bet\nFinance but I don't think that it is a\n5x 10x bet in the next 3\nyears but it's\nright so that is the\nview from that lens let me analyze a\ncouple of stocks this is not a\nrecommendation whatever you want to do\nbut I will just simply apply this\nframework and show it to you just say\nthe first stock that I have been\ncommenting on Is noama wealth right and\nyesterday it gave like around 12% on up\ntoday it gave 8% run up okay 8 9% run up\n8.77 now already I built my position on\nthis right I had been commenting a lot\non this stock also\nand results were exceptionally\n[Music]\ngood but from that perspective p is also\nnot very high for a small cap midcap\ntype of a company on top of that the\ncompany is into wealth\nmanagement for example go check product\nsegment you will see wealth management\nbusiness majority Revenue now the wealth\nmanagement industry in India itself is\ngrowing at 12 to 15% now which is a good\nstrong brand organization that is\nbacking noama wealth so that it is\nformerly wealth\nmanagement\nnot so from that perspective it's not as\nif it's already in a growth industry\nvaluation wealth management is in a turn\naroundc Asset\nManagement last months so I feel wealth\nmanagement is a good space to be in over\nthe next 5 years typically in India this\ntype of company can go 3x to 5x\nso on top of\nthat numbers have been great result\nsize of the company was small and market\ncap was small so from that perspective\nit is according to me a 3X 5x type of a\ngrowth\nstory when you are trying to get\ncompanies which can go 5x 3x 50 60%\ncorrection buying like\na00 if a big investor pulls out 200\nso please have this basic Common Sense\nokay so again that same story so\nsomething with like solar now this is a\ncompany that I'm buying\nwhy March 2022 okay solar industry which\nis the biggest problem that you will\nface regulation\nall that so you have to believe in the\nconcept if Reliance is backing it up\nregulations okay SW solar is what it is\nan EPC engineering procurement\nconstruction now how does EPC business\nsurvive well by getting contracts now\nwhat is contract dating it's Jala game\nokay so why is it that Reliance will be\nunable to get contracts for like this\ncompany\nokay\nand because once the order book is there\nthen they going to fill it then\nrecog so all those basic basic points\nare there\n2022 for example if this hypothesis\nturns right you'll have to then buy it\nat 3x 5x the entire game okay now why am\nI buying s SW Sol as of\nnow used to be\n14 so almost three three and a half\ntimes quick succession okay now another\nquick thing about suon if you study the\nfall of suon right so number one fall or\nthe biggest fall on sulon came from 355\nrupes\nand why because of 2008 crisis something\nsimilar you'll\nnotice why because of 2020\ncrisis the crisis phas is there 2008\ncrisis 2020\ncrisis why because the capital is not\nthere to support these type of\nprojects and they are only able to do it\nwhen they have money lying around and\nduring such phases 2008 2020 uncertainty\nphase so with that lens if we just\nquickly go and study\nsolar\n2020 it kept on going sideways sideway\nsideway\nSideways from this year onwards okay\nand 300 now it as 580 it's not as if ke\nit has gone up like crazy right for\nexample if you look at the market cap it\nis only 135,000 not that big compared to\nSuson and all so can it double from this\npoint yes can it double with reliance's\nhelp yes okay that's the bet that I'm\ntaking you have to do your own analysis\nand confidence then you can buy these\ntype of highrisk\nopportunities I wanted to discuss more\nstocks which was slightly in the risk\ncategory but I think the video will\nbecome really long but I hope that you\ngot the fundamentals perspective and you\nwill be able to do your own research\ntomorrow I will write a detailed note on\nsome of the multibagger opportunities\nthat I'm considering so I will write\nthis note in the next 2 to 3 days on\nmember community and I will continue to\nshare my market updates so again if\nyou're a serious investor and need help\nwith more research\nand so definitely join the YouTube\nmember Community everything is taught as\nper the recent things that are happening\nin the market so\nand that actually adds to your knowledge\nrepository thank you so much for\nwatching I hope you enjoyed this video\nand I will see you soon",

me\n[Music]\ncrazy\n[Music]\nwatch hello and welcome this is it we're\nhere in Milton keing and today we're\nmaking history 20 years ago diatric mat\nshits rewrote the script of Motorsports\nwith a team that's become the forever\nrebels of Formula 1 the racing\nestablishment wrote them off as just a\nfizzy drinks company but the bubbles\nnever burst for Oracle Red Bull Racing\nas we launch this 20th season what we're\ncelebrating is a culture a spirit and an\nattitude that's changed Formula 1\nforever let's take a look at those last\n20 years of doing it the Red Bull\nway another Victory lap for Max staffen\nwho is on his way to win his 34th Grand\nPrix since Bahrain\n2022 re will have a different way of\noperating with the emphasis on people\nbeing themselves when we come together\nas a team we like to feel Unstoppable\nand let people know where we stand do\nsomething that no one else has done\nbefore makes us feel like a family\nwelcome to my world the world of red\nwhen you look at some of the other\nprojects that Red Bull are involved in\nthe extreme sports we're tremendously\nproud to carry the red bull logo it's\nbecome iconic in Formula 1 if you have a\nwill and if you have an idea exciting\nthings are possible you know I didn't\nwant to let him down and did I feel\nready probably not when I first joined\nRed Bull huge change culturally people\nsaw Red Bull as a party team they wanted\nto do things differently you know when\nsomething just feels right and it just\nthere was a natural chemistry from those\nvery first interactions you know are\nthey completely mad is it just parties\nor are they serious you know who's this\nkid Christian Horner and take a massive\n[Music]\nrisk\nwhat a r let's add a stunt and then\nwe're third and that was the first\nPodium you know for the team so it was a\nmassive\nachievement right I don't are you still\nwatching that David that looks like\nSebastian ble went right into the side\nof Mark Weber how do you read that yeah\nI think the Mark was holding position as\nas uncomfortable as it is to call that\nbetween those two guys what the\nhere Mar to slow get him out of the way\nthis is silly sir come on\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nsubastian vle you are the world champion\nthank you boy\nunbelievable we have to remember these\nthings there's no guarantee that take\nlast going to get it while you

our mouth and\nwe work hard this is a take and for the\nfirst time ever a Mexican driver on the\npodium in his home\n[Applause]\nrace check is a\nlegend Max for Ste you are the world\nchampion we are so proud of you oh my\ngod guys I love you so much\nMax you have been absolutely Mighty this\nyear you've LED over a th000 laps 19\nvictories That's History you have just\novertaken a scaring that's a record from\n1952 mate yeah we did that it's been an\nabsolute privilege watching you drive\nthis car that's been built by a team of\nbrilliant\npeople Max for staffen wins 19 Grand\nPrix in a single season literally\nludicrous domination you got build a a\nrocket ship of the\ncar please welcome two men who have been\na part of the story from the very start\nCEO and team principal of Oracle Red\nBull Racing Christian\nHerer oh yeah and we've got Oracle Red\nBull Racing Legend David\nkard gentlemen it's great to see you\nboth and as we just watched there it's\nbeen quite the journey you've been on as\na team now Christian I'll come to you\nfirst because you're now CEO and team\nprincipal of arguably one of the world's\nmost successful high performance\ncompanies but it all started back when\nyou were just 31 years old no former\nexperience in Formula 1 I mean\nreflecting on that as a journey how did\nit all start well it started uh as you\nsay 20 years ago and looking at some of\nthose videos we're all looking a little\nyoung there it's been quite a journey\nand uh you know what we've crammed into\n20 years has been been phenomenal some\nsome highs and lows along the way but an\nawful lot of highs and uh um yeah it's\nbeen very special many highs which came\nfrom you of course David going back to\n2004 when you first joined the team what\nmade you want to work with Christian and\nDi Tri well I'd known Christian actually\nfrom from lower Motorsports I've seen\nwhat he done with his Ard and racing\nteam but the team that was formerly here\nI'd already decided I wasn't going to R\nfor them because I just didn't believe\nin the future investment but when I met\nthe mishit it was absolutely clear this\nwas more than just a branding exercise\nthis was an absolute commitment and that\nvery first meeting he said our goal is\nto win the World Championship and it\nreally took me back because I'm thinking\nwe haven't even got to the first race\nnever mind got about building a team\nthat can compete against you know your\nFerraris and the likes but his vision\nhis commitment Christians leadership\nalong with all of the great technical\nmen and women that have uh been part of\nthis journey has just been incredible so\nwhen we started it was a few hundred\npeople in One factory down at the bottom\nof of this road now we've got the whole\ncampus and what 1500 people or so\nemployed and Counting yeah such an\nincredible journey and of course it was\nclear from the off that you guys meant\nbusiness because in your first race\nsorry Jaguar to throw you in here but in\nthe first race they scored more points\nthan Jaguar had in the entire previous\nseason just saying and then shortly\nthereafter of course this happened so\ntalk us through that moment where you\ngot your first po with Red Bull yeah\nwell Monaco is a circuit that I always\nwent well so I was confident that even\nthough we were still a developing team\nthat there was an opportunity in a track\nlike that to get a result so I was\nconvinced we were capable of making it\ncertainly into some good point scoring\nposition but a Podium of course is uh a\nlandmark for the team look I mean it was\nthe first Trophy and it's it's very\nproudly in our in our cabinet you know\nand you know David was such an important\npart of the early part of Rebel racing\nand again here we are 20 years with with\nhim still Associated and working with\nthe brand absolutely and so would you\nsay that that was the moment that you\nreally felt you'd arrived as a team I\nthink it was an important moment because\nyou know that trophy represented you\nknow what was to come and it also\nrepresented that we were prepared to do\nthings a little differently seeing David\nstanding on a podium in front of Prince\nAlbert in a Superman cape um on Red\nBull's first Podium just showed that you\nknow we were doing it differently we\nwere doing it the Red Bull way yeah I\nthink it's important to mention actually\nat that time Formula 1 was quite a close\nshop you didn't go into the other teams\nit was very much you know each team was\nits own entity Red Bull opened the door\nto the paddock and said the other teams\nwere welcome and at first you could see\nother team members sort of nervously\nwalking up into the energy station\nthinking is something going to happen\nand then over time it just changed the\nwhole philosophy of Formula 1 and the\npadic is a much friendlier place because\nof it absolutely and I know you credit a\nlot of this down to team culture how\nimportant would you say that is in terms\nof success it's everything uh the men\nand women here in molon keing um all the\npeople behind the scenes it's it's out\nof these industrial buildings that uh\nWe've created some of the most\nincredible cars over the last you know\n19 seasons and and uh the late nights\nthe hours the the the the sacrifices\nthat are made it's it is a culture it's\na very inclusive culture it's a team\nculture for me Formula 1 is the biggest\nteam sport in the world and without the\npeople you have nothing and it's the\npeople who are your single biggest asset\nabsolutely now we've spoken a lot about\nteammates and we've heard just how\nimportant the team is so why don't we\nhear from some of the people who have\nall played their part in these Very\nSpecial 20 years three more try to hard\nyour disappointment better than that\nhonestly sake what are we doing here\nthis line of questionings is\nappalling we\ndone that let's get those\nin there are Rebels and character\nthroughout there's so many of them I\nmean you can start with Vash he's got a\nfew Pink Panther moves at some parties\nthat I've seen in action yeah for\nsure well certainly Adrian he does like\na party I've seen him have a good time\non quite a few\noccasions I'm I can be a party animals I\nI don't think I'm the chief party animal\nI can think of a lot bigger protagonist\nhe looks like a university Professor but\nget a Red Bull inside him you know he\njust takes off it's great everybody\nfeels like they can be a part of this\nteam so it's not like a separate them\nand us thing at all in redel it's like\nwe're all a family and a team together\nit has to be fun you have to enjoy what\nyou're doing it's not a nine-to-five job\nin Formula 1 it's a competition it's a\nsport and it's fantastic to see as we\ntravel around the world the amount of\nsupport that the team enjoys in every\ncountry that we go to keep it very\nquickly we established a culture and a\nculture that was inclusive that you know\nthat we were there to operate as a race\nteam you know growing up within the team\nhas been very nice of course everyone\nhas always been very supportive and we\nall always trusted each other and I\nthink that makes our relationship very\nspecial everyone is seeing how they can\nsupport the guy next to\nyou I think Red Bull just came across as\na great place to work where there was\nkind of that fun a bit young and\nenergetic he's a team product he's never\nan individual product you race as one\nteam it's vital isn't it you get\ndifferent views different ideas\ndifferent personalities and how you\nchoose them how you develop them and\nafter developing you how we make it\ntogether\n[Music]\nraw we are now joined by group Chief\ntechnology officer of Oracle Red Bull\nRacing aka the goat of F1 engineering\nplease give it up for Adrien\nnewie welcome Adrian so as you've seen\nwe've been going through the Journey of\neveryone and I want to start off with\nyou going back to 2004 you already had\ntwo decades of experience designing\nChampionship winning cars both for teams\nwhich David drove for so I have to ask\nyou was it a bit of a bromance going on\nthat brought you to Red Bull as it turns\nout the three um teams that David has\ndriven for it's actually the same three\nteams I've worked for and so I've known\nDavid since he was a a Wii test driver\nvery young lad in 1993 I think uh he\nthen moved to McLaren I moved to McLaren\na year after he moved to to Red Bull and\nthen really from there things developed\nand how excited were you David when you\nfound out that Adrien was joining the\nteam well you know Adrien has been\nincredibly successful through his entire\ncareer even prior to Formula 1 so when\nChristian first suggested that you know\nwould Adrian be available at that point\nI was so immersed and trying to\nunderstand where we were as a team I\nhadn't really given that consideration\nbut thankfully he accepted the chall\nChallenge and the invitation and the\nteam of people that he's built here has\nproven out by the success the thing I\nreally love about Adrian as well as\nbeing obviously creative chap pretty\nhandy when it comes to being at the\ndrawing board because uh for those who\nknow Formula 1 closely they'll know that\nAdrian still uses a pencil to design but\nhe's a racer and maybe he doesn't have\nthe same racing success as Max fappen\nbut he has been out on the racetrack and\nhe likes to keep it simple I remember\nonce you know going into great detail\nexplaining everything that was doing on\na lap and at the end of having giving\nthis long explanation he went what do\nyou need to go faster kept it simple and\nthen I went well understair and he went\nokay we'll work on the understair so out\nof all of this sort of you know mess\ngoing on in my head about the journey\naround the racetrack just focus on what\nyou need to go quicker and that\nSimplicity has clearly been very\nsuccessful for him and his team\nincredible now Christian of course even\nthe greatest teams go through\nchallenging moments moments and fast\nforwarding now to 2014 when Mercedes\nstarted to look a little bit unbeatable\nhow did you stay resilient as a team\nwell I think that uh you know that was a\ntesting period for the team that uh\nthere was a big regulation change um\nwe'd gone from En enjoying huge success\nwith Sebastian vettle and those four\nconsecutive World Championships and\nsuddenly for reasons beyond our control\nwe didn't have an engine that that could\ncompete with the likes of you know what\nMercedes had come up with so suddenly it\nwas about keeping the group together\nkeeping the team together staying\nfocused on uh you know addressing the\nweak point and you know focusing on the\nthings that we could control and the\nthings that you know where we could be\nstrong and I think it was that team\nspirit it was that togetherness that you\nknow we didn't lose uh you know key\nmembers of the team during that period\nand we were able to win races every\nsingle year by one until we got\nourselves in a position with a\ncompetitive engine to suddenly then be\nable to go for a championship again now\nwe've spoken a lot about the past but I\nknow that Red Bull is a lot about the\nfuture and in particular backing young\nTalent through the Red Bull Academy\nprogram through Visa cash app RB and\nOracle Red Bull Racing how important is\nit to you to bring in those fresh new\nnames well look it's it's really\nexciting and I think Red Bull have\ncommitted more to Formula 1 Academy than\nany other team in Formula 1 and you know\nwith Oracle Red Bull Racing and Red Bull\nFielding cars and you know the Visa cash\napp RB team also you know putting cars\nout there's going to be a really strong\nRed Bull presence and it's it's great to\nsee you know these young girls getting a\nchance as the sport starts to embrace\nfemale racing absolutely well on that\nnote let's have a look at that next\ngeneration of racing and some very\nexciting young female\nTalent I'm amily the host and I'm ham\nalesi and I'm part of the Red Bull\nAcademy\nprogram a few years ago I couldn't even\nthink about being part of Red Bull it\nwas always a dream F1 Academy is is a\nbig opportunity\nmy ambitions for next season is I want\nto win I want to be champion of course I\nfeel like Red Bull has done many amazing\nthings not just in Motorsport it's\nexciting to to be part of\nit and here they are in the flesh from\nthe Red Bull Academy program it's ham\nalabasi and Amil\ndeou all right so ham I'll come to you\nfirst as you'll be driving for F1\nAcademy for Red Bull Racing tell us a\nbit about your journe into Motorsport\nand how this program is helping you with\nthe next level of your career yeah I got\ninto carting when I was 12 years old and\nI fell in love with the sport\nimmediately and from there we moved up\nthe ladder into F4 and finally into F1\nAcademy last year we ended the season\nvery strong in the top three and now I'm\npart of the Red Bull family and couldn't\nbe more grateful about this opportunity\nsuper excited and amily what does it\nmean to you to be a part of the Red Bull\nfamily and what was your journey into\nMotorsport like well I started carting\nwhen I was 9 years old at the local\ncarding track and in 2021 I started to\ngo in Fula cars and last year I did F1\nAcademy and I won my first race in\nBarcelona and this year I'm part of the\nRed Bull family and I'm really proud of\nthat absolutely you should be it's an\nincredible achievement that you've both\ndone so Christian looking at this seeing\nthe amazing young Talent how special\ndoes it feel to to know that Redbull are\noffering these incredible opportunities\nwell it's it's a great initiative and of\ncourse Red Bull have got a long history\nwith the uh young driver program that\nobviously helmet's done a a great job of\nof running and and nurturing but again\nthis is a new element and with uh F1\nAcademy um Coming really on stream\nsupporting many Formula 1 races this\nyear it was the ideal time to step in\nand identify some young talents well\nbest of luck for the season thank you\nvery much hamda and\namily so I'm now back with Christian\nHerer Adrien newie and technical\ndirector Pierre was welcome so now we\nare getting closer to that big reveal of\nthe rb20 but before we do that let's\njust take a moment to reflect on the\nrb19 because I mean it was a\nrecord-breaking car such an incredible\nmachine so Adrian it'd be great if you\ncould take us back to the drawing board\nthe 19 really was very much an evolution\nof the rb18 of 22 last year's car really\nwas a total surprise in terms of its\ndominance I have to say because we went\ninto that winter of 22 23 thinking yep\num saders won a race near the end in\nBrazil Ferrari was still winning races\nit was it was still very tight and on\nour side we just concentrated on kind of\nimproving some of the weaknesses of the\nthe 22 car and to our complete shock\nreally by half season it was becoming\npretty evident that we had a a march on\num on our competitors and Pier I know\nthat you love that thrill of competition\nthat we' just spoken about is that what\nhelps you to constantly push to find an\nedge yes for sure but you know this\nbusiness of Formula 1 is the highest\nengineering competition in the world but\nto have this success you know you you\nneed to have all Department in our\nbusiness to be competing with other team\nthen the competition is at each level\nand for sure he's making the motivation\ngreat and Christian what brief did you\ngive these guys before they were\ndesigning well look that's not not up to\nme but uh you know the 23 car was really\nan update of the 22 car and\noperationally I think you know Max was\ninsane the way that he drove uh last\nyear so to have achieved all of those\nrecords you know 22 victories uh 19 for\nMax to have achieved first and second in\nthe in the driver's Championship\nsomething we'd never done before um 15\nstraight victories in a row breaking you\nknow McLaren's record from 1988 as a guy\nsay it's down to the people and you need\neverybody in every Department doing\ntheir bit to achieve achieve those kind\nof results you know it was a magical\nyear what's what's the changes for this\nyear's car you have to keep pushing\nwe've made some improvements to the car\nin all areas um mechanical vehicle\nDynamics and\naerodynamics uh is that enough who knows\nwe shall have to see watch this space\nand Pierre do you feel the same way yeah\nwe feel the same way you know just we\ntry to identify where we can gain\nperformance on the car try to also\nunderstand where weakness for the driver\nand after just an evolution of what we\ndid in the previous year\nwell gentlemen thank you so much it's\ngreat to hear your insights and now\nwe've made it to that moment that we've\nall been waiting for the big reveal it's\nyour first sight of a car that's going\nto be making fresh Red Bull history to\nget ready for this it's time to meet

20th\nversion um the guys haven't been you\nknow it's it's not conservative and you\ncan see they've been quite aggressive in\ncertain areas uh you can see all the all\nthe men and women behind the scenes have\nbeen working very hard and some of the\ndetail on the car is absolutely\nExquisite and Max I'll come to you next\nyou had one of the most incredible if\nnot the most incredible season in\nFormula 1 last year you broke your own\nrecord for the most race wins in a\nseason and of course took your third\nworld championship title how excited are\nyou to be driving the rb20 and are

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGwPdUEbI9o",
    "transcript": "first off congratulations if you're\nwatching this video that means you\nalready have your admit in your hands\nand now you have to prove to the Visa\nauthorities that you can actually afford\nyour education in this video I'm going\nto be telling you about how I myself\ncleared my F1 visa interview showed the\nfunds showed the proof of the funds\nbasically and I've helped since then\n20,000 plus cases prove the exact same\ntoday I'm going to be giving you that\nexact information for free I guys my\nname is Yash and I make a lot of videos\nabout studying overseas moving overseas\nand living overseas so if that's your\ngig make sure to subscribe to the\nchannel and follow me on Instagram guys\nin this video we're going to be\ntargeting a couple of questions that are\ncritical for any student who's going for\nstudying overseas in the US because\nthese help you prove the funds without\nwhich of course your Visa will not be\ngiven to you the first question is how\nmuch funds do you need to show second is\nthe forms of funds acceptable what kind\nof funds should you show should you show\nPF should you show bank balance should\nyou show loans should you show stocks\nreal estate what should you show right\nwe're going to be talking about that\nthird very important question which I\nget asked a lot is how long do you need\nto keep these funds in your account\nespecially if you're showing let's say a\nbank statement fourth alternative to\nshowing funds let's say you don't have\nthe money what do you do in that case\nfifth who who are the possible sponsors\nthat you can actually take money from in\norder to show the funds and sixth are\nthe exact documents that you should be\ncarrying with you for the interview\nwe're going to be covering all of these\nsix questions in this video and as a\nbonus I'm going to be telling you how I\nin my own interview got through without\nactually proving the finances well in a\nway we're going to be discussing that as\nwell so guys to be able to answer these\nsix questions I need to explain\nsomething to you and for that let's go\non to the computer and let me actually\nshow you what an I20 looks like and I\nthink this is something that you would\nhave already seen if you know what\nyou're doing over here otherwise if\nyou're seeing it for the first time\ndon't worry this is just your personal\ninformation this is the school\ninformation that you're going for and\nthen there's the program information\nwith kind of a course you're studying\nover there right and finally comes your\nfinancials this is the part that we're\ngoing to be focusing on in this video\nbecause on the left side it tells you\nfor essentially one year itself 9 months\nbut you know essentially approximately\none year leaving out the vacations right\nthese are the tuition and fees these are\nthe living expenses and if you have any\ndependence this is their estimated\nexpense as well so they estimate\neverything for you this is what your\nschool has done for you and then sent it\nto the Department of Homeland Security\nright and this is when you've already\nproven the funds to the school now what\nyou would do is from the right side what\nthey what they what they show on the\nright side is okay how did you prove the\nfunds to the school now these two values\nwill match 32,000 32,000 okay so you\nshowed over here $3,000 of your own\nfunds and 29,000 was given to you as a\nscholarship that means you only have to\nshow $3,000 per anom essentially that\nokay this is what I have to pay and this\nis my bank balance as well right if you\ncould show that that would be good\nhowever do you have to show 3,000 or a\nlittle bit more we're going to talk\nabout that but this is not how how the\nmost of the i20s will look like by the\nway an actual I20 for most of the\nstudents will not have a lot of\nscholarship on it you may have a lot of\nscholarship on it if you're lucky but\nlet's talk about cases where you don't\nand in that case you would have let's\nsay 308,000 tuition living expenses\n23,000 total 61,000 and how do you have\nto prove the funds over here well the\nstudent has taken an education loan and\nshown the rest of the funds from family\nand this is how they're proving it okay\nso this is essentially how the student\nhas proven the funds to the university\nnow this is what you have to do with the\nVISA authorities as well now our first\nquestion how much funds do you need to\nactually show my advice is that you take\nthis number so\n61600 and you multiply it by 1.5 that\ngives you $92,400 if you could show\nsomewhere around this amount okay that\nmeans because your program may not be\njust one year long if it's one year long\nyou know just show 61,000 or even a\nlittle bit lesser is okay but if you if\nyour program is 2 years long for\ninstance then you want to show somewhere\naround 1.5 1.4 times at least right so\nthat what happens is you can show that\nyou'll be able to afford it for the next\nyear as well all right that's\nessentially how you show the funds how\nmuch you show the funds number two let's\nmove on to the forms of funds acceptable\nwhat kind of funds to show so here is a\nlist of documents that work number one\nis bank balance that means you're\nshowing your bank statement right or\nyou're getting a letter from the bank\nstating that this amount is actually\nequivalent to so and so US Dollars and\nyou can actually take it out on any day\nof the week that you want number two way\nis fixed deposits now your fixed\ndeposits should be liquid the keyword\nhere is always going to be liquid if\nyour fixed deposit is liquefiable you\ncan go ahead tomorrow to the bank and\nliquify it get the money in your hands\nget the cash absolutely you can show\nfixed deposits Provident fund yes you\ncan actually show your or your parents\nProvident fund as well it's allowed it\nworks the fourth document is a loan\nsanction letter yes so what that means\nis when you don't really have the money\nyou can just take out a loan now you\ndon't really have to take the loan but\nyoud pay 1% of it you get the sanction\nletter and with what that means is that\nthis letter states that okay if you want\nyou can withdraw up to 90,000 or\nwhatever ,000 you want from this account\nanytime for your education all right and\nthat's how a loan sanct letter works now\nI understand you may have trouble\ngetting loans right and it's difficult\nsome people have no collateral some\npeople have no signers and you may have\nboth of these things but you may have\nsome requirements of lower rates of\nInterest well I'm happy to let you know\nthat you can take a look at our\nEducation Loans page right over here\nwhere you can actually fill up one form\nand this one form will send data to all\nthe major lenders across town get you\nthe best lenders who are interested in\nyour profile and then they'll connect\nwith you and let you know what kind of\nrates they can offer you the best\npossible ones on the market and the best\npart is that the whole process from our\nin is free so you go ahead you fill up\nthis form and we'll take care of\neverything all right the next letter\nthat works is a CA certificate people\nuse it a lot when they have real estate\nthey have assets which are illiquid but\nI personally am against using it so much\nbecause first off it is a very costly\ndocument to acquire I do not believe it\nis worth it secondly in a lot of cases\nif you show illiquid assets which by the\nway the ca will be adding to his CA\ncertificate well a lot of times there\nhave been complications the next\ndocument will be a scholarship or\nFellowship proof remember in one of the\ni20s I showed you there was a $9,000\nscholarship you can actually have a\nproof of that scholarship well your I20\nis proof enough but still you can keep a\nproof from the University in writing\nthey usually send it to you that hey\nyou've been giving this amount of\nscholarship and you can show that as\nwell and finally if nothing works you\ncan show a sponsorship letter or an\naffid ofit what that means is you can\nactually get someone from your family\nand we're going to be talking about who\nyou can get from your family to actually\nsponsor you but still someone from your\nfamily to sponsor you and they can sign\nan eff that yes I'm willing to support\nhis or her education and you know this\nis the amount that I'm willing to spend\nand as long as that amount is you know\nwithin the range that I mentioned\npreviously you're good to go two\ndocuments that I want you to avoid a\nlittle bit all right number one is\nstocks why should you avoid stocks\nthey're fluctuating assets the value\nkeeps on going up and down up and down\ntoday your stocks may be at a great\nvalue tomorrow your Stock May crash you\ndo not know that things happen and you\nknow if you've been in the stock market\nlong enough you would know that stocks\nunless of course the money is\nliquefiable and you you know get out of\nthe stock take the money back into your\nbank account it's really not worth\nshowing the second thing that I would\nlike you to avoid is using real estate\nvaluation documents because real estate\nis usually considered IL liquid that\nmeans if you want today you want to sell\nyour real estate it can be 6 months from\nnow till when you sell it how however if\nyou need the money today for the\nuniversity for the tuition fee\nUniversity will not wait 6 months for\nyour asset to be sold so please keep\nthat in mind question number three how\nlong do you need to keep these funds in\nyour account I would suggest keep them\nfrom 2 to 4 weeks of possible all right\ndon't get the funds today take the\nstatement out you know two days later\nand uh just go to the Embassy for the\ninterview that's very risky very risky\nespecially if you've never held that\nkind of balance before what I would\nsuggest is keep that balance in your\naccount for a while or take a\nsponsorship letter from someone who\nalready has the balance and is ready to\nsponsor you but do not just get the\nbalance today get the print out tomorrow\nand then show it to the Embassy Point\nnumber four alternative to showing funds\nthere's quite a few things you can do\nover here and I'm going to be talking\nabout that in the bonus as well but I\nwould say the best alternative is that\nyou get a loan sanction letter you pay\n1% but you have letter saying that you\nare able to actually afford this program\nessentially because the loaning\norganization is backing you and that's\ngood enough more than good enough number\nfive is the possible sponsors and this\nis very important my friend so listen up\nyour parents can definitely sponsor you\nabsolutely but all your blood relatives\ncan actually sponsor you so your\ngrandparents can sponsor you your dad's\nbrother can also be sponsoring you so\nyour your uncle can sponsor you there's\na lot of people a lot of you know\ncousins can sponsor you it doesn't have\nto be exactly you are very close family\nit can be someone else as well all right\nbut at the end of the day they have to\nsign an effort of it that yes we pledge\nthat we would be supporting this student\nin their education and we are ready to\nspend this amount of money whenever the\nneed for the education let's talk about\nwhich documents to carry for your\ninterviews\nmost important document I20 don't forget\nit take your service fee receipt it's\nalso an important document bank\nstatement if you're proving the funds\nusing your bank balance salary slip\nwhether it's yours or your sponsors\ndepending on who's funding your\neducation should be taken income tax\nreturns for the last 3 years if possible\ntake those it's going to help you\nmassively scholarship proof If you have\na scholarship it may be on your I20 it\nmay not be on your I20 in some cases but\nat the end of the day the university\nmust have sent you a letter with your\nadmission take that proof of fixed\ndeposit or bank balance if you're\nshowing one of these take the proof of\nthat loan sanction letter very important\ndocument if you've taken up a loan\nfinally we get to the bonus part how did\nI get through without actually proving\nany finances so in my interview\nessentially what happened was the\ninterviewer did ask me about how I'm\ngoing to afford the education overseas\nnow I actually cited that my father's\nsalary is so and so my mother's income\nis so and so and combined their income\nis enough to actually afford my\neducation I have tax returns to prove\nthat as well and also salary\nslips now while I had these documents\nand the salary was actually not covering\none full year of tuition to be very\nhonest with you it was you know because\nat the end of day there's a lot of taxes\ngo from the salary right so at the end\nof the day it was not something that we\nneeded to discuss over there but these\ndocuments were still with me and I could\nstill show that you know I'm near about\nthere and what essentially happened was\nthat the officer did not exactly ask me\nanything after that they just approved\nmy Visa they did not ask me to show\nthose documents that did not verify them\na lot of cases your confidence the way\nyou speak matters a lot so if you're\nconfident you know what you're doing\ntrust me you'll get through with or\nwithout it in a lot of cases but of\ncourse don't don't Bank on that in most\nof the cases they will check your\ndocuments so please please please take\nthis video seriously and this is the\nlast step we don't want to mess this up\ncreate documents original documents\ndon't go for fake agents or fake\ndocuments we never recommend that your\nfuture is at stay here my friend all\nright we don't want to be deported do we\nAnd subscribe to the channel if you like\nthe content I'll see you in the next one\ngoodbye\n[Music]\nthank\nhe he hey\n[Music]\nhey",

    "transcript": "hi everyone so this video is an investor\neducation initiative by incred money\nthis is a Sab registered Bond investment\nplatform in case you're interested in\nchecking out and figuring out how to do\ninvestment in bonds do check out the\nlinks in the description and comment box\nthere are more details that we have\npresented the content has been made by\nindustry experts with Decades of\nexperience in bond investing and credit\nanalysis hi everyone welcome to today's\nvideo so a natural question in the\nmarket right now is that should you wait\nfor the market to fall and then invest\nor should you continue to invest because\nthe Market gave a rally and then it has\nbeen consolidating sideways so natural\nresponse you know what let the market\nFall then I will invest should you do\nthat the short answer is no you should\nnot be doing it because then you will\nmiss out on some really great buying\nopportunities my hypothesis is that the\nmarket is very much in the bull run\nright now and the biggest Bull Run is\nyet to come so you should continue to\ninvest in what format I will tell you\nwhat I'm going to do is that I'm going\nto make a macro case I'm going to help\nyou understand macroeconomics\nSensibility in very easy to understand\nlanguage so just a humble request that\nif you do like these type of macro\noriented videos do press the like button\nthat's one second key thing is that I'm\ngoing to go into stock specific things\nmacroeconomics I will give you stockwise\ndetails of some of the good stocks that\nyou could consider buying and some of\nthe stocks that you should be selling\nokay so with that view point in mind let\nus kick start and there are five key\nmacro points that you should know simple\nso the first key point that you must\nunderstand is that the interest rates\nare going to get cut this year now this\nis not just me saying this is what many\neconomists are predicting that there\nwill be multiple rate Cuts this year in\nfact many countries have started to cut\ninterest rate this is a very good macro\nchart it highlights that some countries\nare already cutting interest rate in q1\nof the Year 2024 some are expected to\ncut in Q2 of 2024 so on and so\nand what good will that lead to well\nwhen the interest rates are cut the cost\nof borrowing comes down for example\nthink about it this way that right now\nif you have a home loan and if you have\nrecently picked it up then the Emi\npayment would be at like 9 and a half%\nright so 9 and a half% home loan\ndepending on a lot of other things so\nthis is fairly high if the interest rate\ngets cut then what is going to happen is\nthat that home loan rate is is going to\ncome down similarly any type of\nborrowing rate is going to come down and\nthat is generally good for the market BB\ninterest rate cut and when the interest\nrates are cut and are made low then the\nmarket gives out its biggest\nrally for example if you take a look at\nthis particular chart you will see that\n2008 crisis and from 2009 all the way\ntill roughly 2013 2014 the interest\nrates were close to 0%\ncris8 stock market should have become\nabsolute daba no absolutely not in fact\nif you take a look I will show you\nn50 20089 zero interest rate period and\nall the way till\n20156 2013 so Market almost three times\nin the next 5 years despite the world\nwitnessing its biggest crisis again\nsomething similar happened that in 20120\ncovid crisis was there the interest\nrates were cut to zero again you can see\nthis from the chart that the interest\nrates were close to.\n25% double the stock market in a very\nshort span of time so to cut the long\nstory short whenever interest rates are\ncut that is when we see the biggest\nstock market rally right now in actual\nterms we are at 5 and a half 6% interest\nrate this is going to get cut this year\nand in 2025 also expectations are that\nit will start to get cut somewhere in\nthe second half of 2024 and the game is\ngoing to continue all the way till 2026\nokay so this is a perod which might be\nvery useful for the market but a counter\nargument counter argument is that see\nelections are going to happen so we\ndon't know what happens after election\npolicy continuation will be there or not\nthere so all those things need to be\nfactored in but if you just keep the\nnext 6 to 12 months view point we should\nstill remain in the market we should\ncontinue to buy it okay so this is point\none interest rate it's not what I'm\nsaying it it's what economists are\ngenerally telling us so this is first\nkey factor the second key key factor is\nthe movement of money from bond market\nto equity market and from Equity Market\nto bond market now whenever the money\nmoves from Equity Market to bond market\nthe equity Market or the stock market\nFalls when opposite happens market and\nthe money moves from bond market to\nequity Market the stock market\nRises so in case you're enjoying this do\nconsider subscribing to this Channel and\nalso press the like button because\nso hopefully you will like it right now\nwhat has happened in the last two years\nis that the bond market was giving very\ngood returns now what is the meaning of\nthis well in simple term it means that\nfor example if the base interest rates\nare close to 6% now this is fairly High\nrate of interest that people can make or\ninvestors can make by staying in the\nbond market so\nBond now what will happen is that as the\ninterest rate gets cut what will happen\nis that instead of this being 6% it will\nbecome 5 and a half%\nthen 5% then 4 and a half% right so on\nand so\nforth know\nwhat so I will go to equity market and\nwhenever money starts coming to the\nequity Market what will happen to the\nequity Market it will become a rocket\nthe returns that you will make you will\nsee very strong returns and in that\ncontext you need to understand that when\nwhen money is shifted from bond market\nto equity Market what type of stocks are\ngoing to give a r up\nthis is something that I will teach on\nmy member Community also I write posts\nlike these Concepts so I'll write a post\non this tomorrow okay so to cut the long\nstory short this is the second key thing\nthat is going to happen in the next 6 to\n12 months and therefore I feel that the\nmarket is still very much bullish the\nthird key thing that is happening in the\nmarket is that the consumer demand will\nbe revived in the next 1 to two years\nnow what you need to understand is that\nin the last 2 years basically our GDP\nhas gone up now why does the GDP go up\nbecause the private expenditure goes up\nor the government expenditure goes up or\nboth the things go up and that is one\naspect of understanding GDP private\nconsumption\nmeans spending more money in the economy\nand as a result you know the economy is\ngrowing and GDP is growing on the flip\nside what can happen is that the\ngovernment is spending a lot of\nso in Indian context what has been\nhappening is very simple if you go and\nlook at public sector units the\ngovernment is actually selling it stake\nright% holding now they have brought it\ndown to 60% so they have sold like 10%\nof holding that they\nhad now this money they have actually\ngone and spent on developing\ninfrastructure GP right so the last two\nyears have been about government\nspending and the government is taking\nmore and money on deficit it is\nfinancing its infrastructure spent by\nwhat I just told you so government\nspending has been high okay and now it\nis estimated that the government\nspending is going to be lesser in the\nnext 2 years this is a negative point\nabout the economy that the government\nspending will be less why because\ngovernment has decided that it is going\nto reduce something called as fiscal\ndeficit right your fiscal\ndeficit they are going to bring it down\nto roughly 5 4 and a half 5% over the\nnext 2 years so what that indirectly\nmeans is that the government spending is\ngoing to go low okay very important\npoint you have to be little bit careful\nwhich brings me to what type of stocks\nyou can sell okay so let me just quickly\nshow something to you so for example if\nyou take a look at rvnl\nright for example ratio is highest ever\nPE ratio right so it's the most\nexpensive so to say right price right\nfor example in 2022 the stock used to\ntrade at 33 rupees and it made a peak of\n320 rupees so almost 10 times stock\nright and it has now corrected by a lot\nand straight line decline if if the\nfundamentals of the company are not\naligned with the stock price growth okay\nI'm not saying that you know only rvnl\nand you know all\nthefc but the probability of fall is\nmuch much higher okay so for example why\nam I saying it right simp profit Revenue\npre it was at\n10,000 what about net profits\ndou and how much has the stock price\ngone up by\nright\nprice the stock price like 189 rupes or\nsomething and yeah it became like 15 16\ntimes okay now does the stock price\nincrease align with the performance of\nthe company the short answer is no this\nis a sentiment driven\nrally yes the government was obligated\nto spend money in order to increase GDP\nover the last two years\nsoash and then you'll be stuck with\nthese type of stocks for 10 10 15 15\nyears right so be a little bit careful\ndo not build positions on these type of\ncompanies this is what I would suggest\nfrom a macro point of view that the risk\nreward does not make any sense so okay\ncoming back to the point that I was\nmaking that the private spending is\ngoing to increase for\nexample\ndurables why you know people are not\ngoing to buy like washing machine TV AC\nand all this stuff but if you go and\ncheck and that has been a problem for\nthe last 3 four years if you go and\ncheck stocks like world poool and all\nthat three four year negative returns\nright so I mean which is really really\nbad from that perspective what is the\nnumber one reason for that\nwell durable\nLo consumer Dem private demand is not\nthere now government is not going to\nsell at stake and buy like washing\nmachines okay so that is not going to\nhappen the Revival of consumer durable\nstocks will happen when private sector\nspending increases okay so this is\nlikely to increase now why because the\nsentiments on private spending has been\nthe lowest now right it is probably at\nits worst phase now right private\nspending also happens in a\n[Music]\ncycle then people start getting job\nright so whatever goes up comes down and\nwhatever goes down also in a way comes\nback up right so from that perspective\nit's a good cycle right and private\nsector demand is likely to revive what\ngovernments are betting on is the fact\nthat see if the government spending is\nbrought down by 10% then private\nspending is likely to increase by\n10% then what is it that the government\nis going to\ndo okay so that this balance game is\nsomewhat maintained\nand that it might take roughly like 6 to\n12 months for private sector spending to\nincrease but once that starts to happen\nfmcg consumer durable companies are\nlikely to give very good run up right\nexactly I will let you guys know right I\nwrite these type of detailed post on my\nYouTube member community in case you are\na serious\ninvestor knowledge your knowledge will\ngo up dramatically I am already telling\nyou people have been extremely happy\nwith the entire experience of community\nmembership so try it out for a couple of\nmonths and you yourself will see a\ndifference the fourth key point is\nregarding the government spending as I\nwas speaking on the earlier point I will\nnow explain it slightly differently by\nusing some data right so for example\ntake a look at this particular chart and\nwhat you will notice is that this 2023\nis the actual spending by the government\nright and gross tax collection total\ndirect tax collection fiscal deficit\nfiscal\ndefic that government is earning 100\nrupes okay and it is doing a or\nexpenditure of 106 rupees then what is\nthe fiscal deficit fiscal deficit is\nroughly 6% okay so that is the meaning\nof fiscal deficit that government\nearning but it is spending money by\nborrowing money right so that is that\nreflects in the form of deficit now what\ngovernment is telling you now is that\nsee these are our revised estimates\nthese are our budget estimates and as\nper these different estimates this is\nthe likely scenario in 2024 and 2025\nthat we are going to move from 6.4%\ndeficit to 5.1% deficit so this is a big\ncut so they are going to slow down in\nterms of spending money on\ninfrastructure projects I'm not saying\ninfrastructure B all I'm saying is that\nthere will be slow down in expenditure\nfor example public sector units so they\nif they are running without fundamentals\nit becomes a problem example irfc right\nso for example right it's a almost\n200,000 CR company right this is not a\nsmall cap midcap type of a company and\npeople are betting it double right so\nokay let's go 2021 this is where the\nstory starts 24 25 rupes right okay so\nit became how much like seven eight\ntimes right so this is like absolute\ncrazy growth the chances of it falling\nis much much higher compared to chances\nof it growing okay so because the\ngovernment cannot keep on spending money\nat the same rate as it has been doing\nmore importantly we don't know in which\narea the government will spend on\ninfrastructure for example\nsubcontracting\nprojects roads transport Focus instead\nof rail so it's very hard to guess there\nis much higher likelihood of failure by\ninvesting in these type of\nstocks 100%\nit's not as if that I have miss you\ncannot make money from every single\nstock that is out there and\nrally listed stocks there are 6,000\nlisted stocks in India can you make\nmoney from every single bet that you are\ntaking no all you have to Simply do is\nportfolio you invest like let's say 5\nsix seven lakh rupees a year andal right\nyour goal is I make like 25 30% Returns\non my Capital right and beat the market\nthat is what your goal is so as long as\nthat is happening sensibly without you\ntaking unnecessary risk staying in the\nmarket for long term those are the\nthings that you need to understand my\nstudents understand all these\npoints\ngain has grown a lot\nNAC there are like 100 different things\nso right now I'm putting a lot of money\nin micro caps I feel that there is a\ngood rally that is about to come in\nmicro cap segment why Fifth and final\nreason when the interest rates are high\na lot of companies default on their debt\nnow what type of companies will default\non their debt well these would be\ncompanies cash flows small companies\nthey will struggle to expand their\noperations they might not be profitable\nso in a high interest rate phase of the\neconomy these companies get crushed okay\nso two two and a half years the interest\nrates have been very high micro cap\ncompanies small cap midcap companies\nCrush majority of them have already\ngotten crushed now when the interest\nrate goes low these type of companies in\na growing economy one could say that\nthey have been able to survive so at\nleast and if there is no problem in the\nmidcap small cap micro cap segment then\nthese are the type of companies that can\neasily double example solar right now\nthis is a company in in which Reliance\nhas picked up stake in the year 2022\nokay and S SW solar compon energy say\nright so I will just do that comparison\nvery quickly so what you will notice\nis this is a 13,000 CR company this is\nnot very big like irfc you know rvnl and\nall that stuff solar is a growing\nindustry so to say support and when does\nthe support happen well the support\nhappens when the economies are growing\nfor example one of the Prime reasons why\nsuzon energy got crushed for example\nsuon energy used to be like a\nmultibagger stock so to say up until\n20088 and then it fell all the way all\nthe way to 178\nR8 because that was the shrinkage phase\nof the\neconomy donation grants government\nspending on like Renewables this that\nwhen does it pick up well it picks up in\na good economy when the interest rates\nare low\nfunding so 20 8 2020 these were bad\nphases so to say temporarily\nright for\nexample right it was trading at 600\nrupees it fell all the way to 97 by 2020\nright so and after that it has been\nconsolidating compared to other solar\ncompanies so to say it has not given the\ntype of run up that other solar\ncompanies have given this is a small cap\nstock of course there is risk I'm not\npushing you to buy this stock I'm simply\nhelping you understand understand the\nrational and it has been bagged by a big\nplayer for example Reliance is a very\nbig player regulation it can handle\nturnaround stock according to me solar\nis in that turnaround\nphase 15% all that stuff so to cut the\nlong story short these are Central macro\npoints that you need to understand now\ncomes a very natural\nresponse you are talking about all this\nstuff and there is a chance that these\nstocks will not grow of course the there\nis a very high chance that these stocks\nwill not grow problems maybe economy\nwill shrink who knows maybe there will\nbe a new war maybe China will suffer lot\nmore than we are expecting so in that\nsituation there is likely to be high\nvolatility in the market for the next 2\nyears\nbecause for example interest rate cut\nright it used to be let's say somewhere\nin 2008 roughly\n5.25 200\nsimilarly right from for example in 2022\nand we are in 2024 again interest rate\nfor two years interest rate kept on\ngoing up so the next two years are going\nto be about interest rate Cuts so it\nmight take from 2024 to 2026 for the\ninterest rate to go from 6% all the way\ntill New Normal whatever that is roughly\nlet's say\n3% right so in this 2ear period there\nwill be high vola\nin the market now\nvolatility for example we are at 21,600\nright now okay so volatility it will\nprobably trade in this range okay so for\nexample maybe the market will be like\nlet's say 30,000 and all the way to\n20,000 so market right for the next two\nyears so this is the range in which it\nwill move when the interest rate gets\ncut then there will be another big rally\nthat is likely to come so this is what\nmy approximation is for the next 2 years\nbecause the economy looks more stable\nthan it was looking in the last 3 to 4\nmonths now why did that happen because\none of the primary concerns or there\nwere two primary concerns one was\nregarding the US growth rate so the data\nis coming in regarding the US growth\nrate it looks okay there is no problem\nin terms of us growth rate job situation\nno issues there second was the problem\nwith the Chinese economy that their real\nestate market had completely crashed and\nthere was massive pain in the Chinese\neconomy Chinese and Alibaba stocks\nbecause of that reason and it's still\ngoing down because of that reason so the\nextent of damage people were expecting\non the Chinese economy now economists\nare coming out saying Dage it's okay\ndamage I mean it's it's bad that Chinese\neconomy is not growing uh but to cut the\nlong story short the situation they were\nexpecting maybe like you know 100 units\nof damage but the damage has been 80\nunits right so from that perspective the\nsituation in China also does not look\nthat bad so therefore it is being\ndoubted that for the next couple of\nyears there is unlikely to be any major\ndangers to the world economy a major\ndanger already world is rebuilding from\nthat and once things are back on track\njust for example inflation problem solve\nright for example political stability\nright I mean one could argue that it is\nRise of rightwing all across the world\nfor example\npuy all that\nstuff so from that perspective there is\nmore political stability in the world so\nto say and when the interest rates are\nmade low for example 3% or 0% hopefully\nthen the world is going to trade more\nand that will be good for the world so\nto say so that is my hypothesis there is\nthere are problems around debt which can\ntranslate into bigger problems in the\nworld but by keeping the market sideways\nvolatile this debt can also be brought\ndown not in absolute term but the growth\nrate of debt will be brought down okay\nso that is likely to happen\nhopefully now a natural resp\ncome right\nsee also hedging my portfolio for that I\ninvesting in something called as MLD\nMarket linked debentures expl now what\nare exactly Market linked debentures so\nfor example when big investors invest\nmoney for example if they are buying\nlet's say 10 crores of HDFC Bank stock\nokay so as a this is called as naked\nposition\nokay\nhfc this 10 Capital becomes like 2 right\nvery quickly\nbut in case this happens right so big\ninvestors who are putting big big money\nin the market what they do is that they\ndo something called as hedging okay so\nthey will for example uh buy insurance\nvia derivative products or they can buy\ncall putut options in order to hedge\ntheir\nportfolio we can execute it and in that\nway our loss is reduced now for retail\ninvestors like you and me it's a problem\nbecause which expiry to buy how to\nsquare off positions taxation\ntreatment so for that you can buy mlds\nokay so these are Market linked\ndebentures these are principal protected\ntype\nmlds if you put 100 rupes then the value\nof that 100 rupes will remain 100 rupees\nworst case scenario okay so this is\nworst case scenario best case scenario\nyou are going to make 33% or 33 rupees\non it okay and let me just give you\ndifferent scenarios of the market that\nhow does this particular MLD works and I\nhave linked one of my articles on MLD\nyou can go and read it understand it\nmore and then if it makes sense for you\nyou can take some positions via MLD see\nnegative scenario for example Market\nfrom roughly\n21,500 and it falls to 17,600 so this is\nroughly a 20% Nifty loss in your case if\nyou have put money in MLD your loss will\nbe 0% over the next 2 years okay bullish\nscenario right then you'll make even\nmore money the point is that your\ncapital is not lost that is the good\npart of investing in this MLD in case\nyou want to understand more I have\nlinked My article you can go and read it\nB specific stocks key right and which is\nmany people might be waiting but I'll\njust give you a very quick picture here\nand this is a very interesting chart\nthat you can take a look right so for\nexample here what is happening is that\nthis gives you a forward 12 Monon price\nto earning ratios of different\nIndustries is say every single industry\nis overvalued just a consumer dur\ndiscretionary or Consumer Staples be\novervalued why because consumer demand\nis less so therefore it is expected\nearnings that is what analysts are\nexpecting so except for private Banks\nand maybe Finance stocks every other\nsector is\novervalued why 80 85% of my money is now\nin finance here is the reason why okay\nthat right now banks are somewhat\nundervalued except for banks in the\nIndian economy most of the things are\nunfortunately\novervalued again I had given you the\nreason when I was discussing macros that\ndue to government spending government\nspends on infrastructure right so\ninfrastructure right and private\nconsumption consum Staples Consumer\ndiscretionary it yeah it's just in bad\nshape we don't know what is going to\nhappen next I'll make like a separate\nvideo on my Hindi Channel I will link it\nit somewhere in the description comment\nbox you can go and check it out right I\nwill give you industry specific\nViewpoint of different different stocks\nso to cut the long story short here are\nthree four key points I will tell you\nabout stocks see it D we don't know what\nis going to happen there is no clear\nindication where growth is going to come\nfrom I hold it I have started to sell it\nokay so very simply put 36% gain m in\nthe it index in less than a year very\nhappy with that but now I started to\nexit positions because I don't know\nwhere the next round of growth is going\nto come midgap it I'm not buying at all\nright I see very big risk in that\nrvnl\nsector because government is likely to\nsell some Holdings in it and bl\ndeal and you might not be able to exit\nit sensibly if you are looking for multi\nBaggers then picking something like\nmicro caps might make the most sense\nright now I will give you a detailed\nView point on micro cap investing over\nthe next 15 days on my YouTube member\nCommunity Channel right I will write\ndetailed\npost I have started to build positions\non micro caps on top of that if you're\nlooking for safe investment options it's\nprivate sector Banks right\nnow Anis on different different sectors\nso that will give you more confidence\nCommodities now it is a very dangerous\ntime for\nCommodities gasia and all that stuff\ndangerous stuff right now because we\ndon't know to what extent governments\nare going to spend money right because\ninterest rate cut then it's mostly about\nprivate consumption right it's not that\nmuch about government spending so be a\nlittle bit sensible finally prepare for\nvolatility two years is going to be a\nvolatile phase because interest rate it\nwill not come in one only right so so\nthat's the Viewpoint I hope that it gave\nyou sense it gave you Clarity on how you\ncan redesign your portfolio in case\nyou're considering that thank you so\nmuch for watching and I'll see you very\nsoon investments in debt Securities\nMunicipal debt Securities securitized\ndebt instruments are subject to risks\nincluding delay and or default in\npayment read offer documents carefully\nbefore investing",

    "transcript": "Minister by my colleague business the\ntelevision's managing editor sidat\nzarabi ma'am I want to start by getting\nyou to talk about the comparism between\nthis interim budget and the last couple\nof interm budgets which happened just\nbefore the announcement of Elections\nthere was always a lot of populism you\nchose to stay away from that are you\ndeliberately sending out a message that\nI'll be back in July and I'll do what I\nneed to at that time I don't need to do\nanything right\nnow well the message about us coming\nback is the the way in which you all\nreporting about things how the\ngovernment has performed how in the last\n10 years those promises which were given\nwere\nfulfilled\nand on the ground actually people are\nactually speaking about the work of this\ngovernment and not a whisper of\ncorruption so that's the message which\npeople are themselves giving Which you\nthe media are carrying but I've taken\nthe interim budget as an interim\nbudget and asked asking for a w on\naccount just to keep the business going\nof the\ngovernment is what it is meant for have\ndone only that when you do a temperature\ncheck of the Indian economy what is it\nthat gives you the greatest reason for\noptimism and what is it that's giving\nyou nightmare or the most concern at\nthis\nmoment\num the optimism bit is because the power\nof the word of\nmouth people people who have benefited\nfrom government's\npromises are speaking about it\nthemselves and they are cross the board\nthey don't belong to any one section one\nregion one state one language one\nreligion they are all\nover and that gives trust in people's\nmind people trust you will probably\ntrust your friends your neighbors your\npeers your colleagues rather than\ntrusting a political leader by Nature\nIndia is like that and therefore when\npeople say yes I've also got a house\nhere's the paper I've got the gas\nconnection what has come to my uh\ntap and my sons are or daughters are\ngetting skills they are getting\nrecruited they going into you know Arm\nForces Med colleges signic schools so\nthat power of that word of mouth among\nbeneficiaries or potential beneficiaries\nis the one which makes me feel that\npeople realize this is a govern prom\nwhich promises and delivers and the\nprime minister is absolutely seized of\neverything that is happening in the\nground that is one confidence the other\nconfidence try as they may the\nopposition in the their rulle states as\nwell have not matched this kind of\nperformance and top it all with no one\ngetting any personal Peary\nbenefit not one scandal in 10\nyears the image of India fragile five\npolicy paralysis corruption at every\nlevel changed in 10\nyears you think people of India don't\nrecognize that so that's the confidence\nChallenge and worry concerns you yeah\nChallenge and worry more external Wars\nabroad you know uncertainty in the red\nsea fish Marine Lines getting\naffected Transportation Supply chain\ndisruptions those I think in the last 3\n4 years if you can say with sense of\nconfidence uncertainty has become the\nrule of the game we have to live with it\nwe have to factor in for it since you\nspeak about living with uncertainty and\nfactoring it in 10 years of modomics and\nyou said no scandals why the need for a\nwhite paper uh on the state of the\neconomy that the Modi government\ninherited why now\nprime minister himself has spoken about\nin 2015 or 16 he said then that there\nwere a lot of people suggesting to him\nthat he'd come out with a white paper\nand he chose not to do it\nthen and he explained the reasons as was\navailable to him at that time he said no\nlook I'll put my nation first I don't\nwant to come up with a white paper which\nis going to reveal all that was left for\nus to inherit and that would only affect\nthe investors confidence it can affect\nthe trust that the government the people\nof India have in India's own\ninstitutions so it's not the best thing\nfor me to do now so I won't do it now\nbut after 10 full\nyears and after 10 full years of us very\nclearly delivering on our\npromises taking Indian economy closer to\nbeing the third largest economy\nrealizing it probably within a year or\ntwo after we come back let us\nsay we are now in a safe position to say\nto the people of India this is exactly\nwhat we inherited this is what it took\nfor us to correct it and in 10 years if\nthis is the level of effort we've put\nnot just to restore it but to take it to\nthat\nheight it is this kind of a leadership\nand decision making which we've given\nyou in the last 10 years now that you\noted us so right time to bring it in I\nwould think' there's a lot of\nconversation about what's going right I\nwant to use this opportunity to talk\nabout a couple of areas of concern one\nis on Rural consumption I was reading\nthe earnings reports of several of these\nfmcg companies which seem to suggest\ndepending on which company you look at\nat least a 20 to 30% decline in rural\nconsumption a lot of left leaning\neconomists use this to suggest that\nthere is a high level of rural distress\nas Finance Minister how do you look at\nthis concern that uh in the rural sector\nwhen it comes to consumption a lot of\ncompanies are actually seeing distress\nhow much of a concern is that for you\nand how are you hoping to address\nthis I wouldn't just put them aside I\nwouldn't say no I'm not worried about it\nand I wouldn't say that their studies\nare worth nothing no not at all I would\ncertainly give it my best of attention\nbut I'm not sure it is that 20 30% that\nyou're talking about fmcb companies do\nhave um metrics which we need to take\nseriously because it indicates quick\nbuying of durable goods but equally it\nis not correct to say that\nrural distress is continuing because I\nthink there's a lot of shift in the way\nin which rural economy is now going\nthrough\nthere's a lot of shift because money is\ngoing in in the name of you know one or\nthe other scheme to every family in the\nrural area I would dare say this that\nthere is no family left without getting\nat least one or the other scheme of the\ngovernment so those who deserve it rural\neconomy is also looking at a changing\nParadigm in\nagriculture a lot of uh you know\ncommercial crops are coming in the\nlinkages through the E National\nagriculture Market even today there are\nmedia reports about how between\ndifferent markets in different regions\nbetter rate is\nactualized so farmers are now seeing\npotential for them to move to different\ncrops the emphasis given to the Shri and\nthe millets the emphasis given to\nHorticulture is finding newer markets\nwithin their locality the Urban centers\nclose by are benefiting by the\nHorticulture reaching them locally and\nin reasonable price so really it's no\nlonger wheat and rice economy it is a\nlot more of horticulture Fisheries\nlivestock is gaining a lot of attention\nalso supported by the policy of the\ngovernment SGS which are now into value\naddition in food and also with\nmechanization of\nAgriculture which is bringing the\nmonotony down not throwing people\nout themselves are becoming centers for\nbusiness agriculture let's say a\nfarmer's son or daughter sets up a\nbusiness for Lending Leasing and hiring\nout\nequipments companies are coming in Into\nThe Villages saying we not all of them\nwant tractors but hes trying to deweed\nevery such small agricultural equipment\nis now Finding Traction for which their\ntheir sons and daughters themselves are\nsetting up businesses so there's a lot\nhappening in rural areas Finance\nMinister you uh gave a very interesting\nuh definition of secularism and you\nlinked it to saturation of the\navailability of all government schemes\nexpand on that is that now uh the new\ndefinition that the Modi government is\npushing out for secularism because it's\na word that has drawn a lot of debate in\nthe past that's right and uh not just in\n24 elections even in 2019\nby which time uila had reached good\nDimensions you had people belonging to\ndifferent communities particularly when\nyou talk of glass gas cylinders only\nwomen come forward to talk about it men\nthink it doesn't matter to them because\nultimately the food has reach the table\nhow does it matter whether it is being\ncooked in gas or anything else so men\ntend to talk less about it women come\nout to say yes I'm benefiting with a gas\ncylinder people who came out to say that\nUla has helped me to bring a clean air\nin my kitchen and I'm more efficient in\ngetting my food done belong to all\ncommunities even at that time it was\nobserved by media observed by political\nobservers that Wala scheme's\nimplementation has proven that every\neligible person gets it not just the\nfirst charge going to one particular\nsection as it was narrated once earlier\nby a prime minister\nso that litmus test of te secularism\nactually in\naction has been felt even in 2019 now\nit's felt even more so if secularism has\nto be practiced you don't need to Pander\nto religious beliefs if you're able to\nacross the board give everybody\neverything you are indifferent to the\nperson's Faith or religion but making\nsure he or she is as good as the other\nnext\ndoor that's action secularism in action\nma'am let's spend a moment on household\nsavings which have been one of the\npillars of the Indian economy in Years\nGone by and now household savings are\nset to be at a five decad low uh at 5.1%\nhow how are you looking at the aspect of\nIndian households seeming to save much\nlesser than they have in past decades\nand is that something that you're okay\nwith is that something that\nconcerns conclusion you can arrive\nat households saving lesser than before\nno because as much as you talk about\nsmall savings and quote numbers on it\nthe only option that small saving or\npeople in middle classes had for saving\ntheir money and with some confidence was\nto put it in let's say post office\nsavings account which continues which is\ngood enough which can continue any\nlonger but your also noticing since\n2020 that because of Greater\ntransparency and greater availability of\ninformation people are able to see which\nare those performing companies they're\nnot even going through the rout of\nmutual funds to understand how stock\nmarket performs small saving in the name\nof retail funding is coming into the\nstock markets and coming through demat\naccounts which are unique so I'm not\ntalking about the same person doing five\ntypes of Investments new demat accounts\nunique demat accounts tell you probably\nmany things which went to post offices\ncame are coming now into the market so\npeople are finding newer revenues to\nsave and probably better returns are\nacred in those routs since we speaking\nabout the markets uh the stock market\nregulator recently put out a word of\ncaution with regard to uh you know a lot\nof the trades that are happening are\nhappening in trading in in the\nderivatives segment in F\nAndo do you share that note of concern\nwith regard to the nature of how people\nare trading in the markets that was uh\nmuch higher than what it is now I would\nthink my concern that is much higher\nearlier than it is now because there's a\nlot of awareness being built by\nRegulators to say that uh derivatives\nand dealing in fno as you said can have\ninvolve high risk and many people burned\ntheir fingers uh by starting to operate\nthere young people who with the first\ntime entrance also burnt their fingers\nso there was a lot of discussion about\nit in one of our FS DC meetings uh\nRegulators are now building a lot of\nawareness and uh I would think that\ncaution has come into play now Finance\nMinister how are you you've been chiding\nIndia Inc to go out and invest to find\nthe strength of Hanuman and to invest in\nthe India story and for various reasons\nthe kind of secular investment cycle\nthat you were hoping for hasn't really\nkick started you can see some green\nshoots in some sectors but it's not an\noverall investment cycle uh how are you\nviewing because I I we were together at\nthe rashtrapati bav and you were telling\na member of India Inc to go out and\ninvest even further how are you looking\nat India Inc in several sectors still\nbeing in waitand watch mode assessing\nbut not committing fully to invest at\nthis moment is that now beginning to get\na little frustrating for you how are you\nlooking at investment appetite and\nactual Investments apart from just the\ntalk but uh I would equally say that in\nthose Sunrise sectors which for which\nwe've announced PL schemes and so\non you find private investment coming in\nand coming in in significant numbers so\nI really cannot say now as I said\nearlier that hey you are anuma Hanuman\nyou start playing it is happening now\nand I would think they are very clear in\ntheir heads that their Investments now\nwill probably go through the newest\nsectors and they may want to build\ncapacities add capacities to the\nexisting areas of activity but many of\nthem are now looking at prospects in the\nnewer areas so it is happening but\nhappening much more in the newer Sunrise\nsectors Finance Minister U two key\ninstruments of the government which have\nfocused on getting new manufacturing and\nprivate investment the point that was\njust made one of those schemes of 2019\nthe end date is 31st March 2024 the\nconcessional 15% rate for new\nmanufacturing uh companies along with\nthat you've given a host of PL schemes\ntwo parts to the question one do you see\nthe need for continuing with that lower\n15% rate eventually perhaps in the full\nbudget and second uh does p scheme need\nto expand or at some point of time the\ngovernment will say we supported you as\nmuch as we could now go on and do it on\nyour\nown uh the answer to your second\nquestion is not uh we've done it for a\nfew years so stop it now it's more to\nensure that India gets that lead in\nthose sectors in the sunrise areas so I\nwouldn't time it by saying I've done it\nfor 2 years shut shop now that that will\nnot be my Approach my Approach would be\nis it really getting rooted in India is\nit sustainable and are are these\nindustries really you know taking off so\nthose will be my measure before I take a\ncall on that so I wouldn't rush to say\nI've done it for 2 years the other is\nabout uh\nthe reduced tax\nrates as I said for many other things\nthis interim budget was not the time for\nme to take a call on that so I've not\ntaken a call one of the critics we've\nheard from the opposition finance\nminister is that when it comes to social\nsector because the percentage of\ngovernment outlays on education on\nhealth has come down as a percentage of\nour GDP in the years that this\ngovernment has been on power they level\nthe acquisition that while you're very\nfocused on public infrastructure uh that\nthe amount of money that should be set\naside for education and for healthcare\nisn't adequate and even the outlays that\nare being made are not being fully spent\nwe're actually spending lesser than we\nprovision for how do you look at this on\nthe outlay not getting spent I may not\nbe the best person to answer I'll be\nconcerned as to why the outlays are not\ngetting spent but it'll be the\nDepartments and in particularly health\nand education States also have a role it\nis a concurrent uh list of items that\nwe're talking about when we talk about\neducation and health so it will depend\non how much absorption Happ happens in\nthe states how much the department is\nable to push and so on so those factors\nare totally out of my realm but I can\nunderstand where they are and probably a\nlonger discussion can happen only on\nthose two uh issues um it's also not\nright to measure expenditure on\neducation and health as being adequate\nor not adequate it can never be adequate\nI'll concede that any amount that I put\nfor Education will still think I mean\nyou'll think I'll think anybody will\nfeel more can be added and yes more can\nbe added there cannot be a second\nthought on that but the fact remains\nas I said also for one question earlier\nsomewhere else about capital expenditure\nthis time being not 30% in increase only\n11%\nincrease there's after all a element\nwhich is called absorption capacity you\ncan put ton loads of money somewhere and\nthe in the capex our condition was you\nuse it within 12 months I'll give you\nnext year but use what I've given you\nnow fully this year the absorption\ncapacity element makes many of them who\ngenuinely want to spend it after a point\nnot able to throttle it down within 12\nmonths they would need 13 14 15th month\nalso but I'm sorry within 12 month it\nhasn't happened fully so is the case\nwith education and health you may want\nto put any number into the\noutlet but eventually unless there's a\nproperly fitted Hospital you're not\ngoing to be able to give additional\ntraining to the staff\nand spend money on that unless you have\nmore medical seats available you're not\ngoing to have enough doctors coming into\nthe hospitals unless again it is spread\nall over the country that's why at one\npoint in time I remember during my atbar\nannouncements we said no longer are we\nlooking at District level hospital now\nit has to go to the Block Level so there\nare levels and levels to which we need\nto now pad with more efforts and\nresources so it's not not going to\nhappen within one year suppose I say I'm\ngiving more enough this year of the\nGDP are they in a position to absorbed\nthe first layer is being set second\nthird and so on I can't STP at the fifth\nlevel when these have not been done\nFinance Minister since we are speaking\nabout allocations um explain the\nphilosophy on the defense allocation\nyou've been defense minister you've been\nCommerce Minister and defense still\nabout 6 lakh CR the highest allocation\nbut some people say it's still 4 4.72%\nyear- on-year growth uh earlier than\nthat in the previous Financial year\nthere was a substantial increase what's\nthe philosophy behind the defense budget\nallocation first of all defense and\ntheir procurement you know it coming\nfrom a defense background uh your friend\nRahul will know it we shared that\nbackground yes the\nlong-term perspective planning that the\ndefense has is really long time and they\ngo on fitting every year to towards\nachieving that long-term\ngoal and for each year it's not a\nproportionate allocation towards that\nlong term sometime it's more sometimes\nit's less sometimes it's just about all\nright and so on so it is the end goal\nthat your long-term perspective plan\nwhich has to be achieved and in the\nprocess allocations keep going up and\ndown in order that we get a complete\npicture of how money is got to be\nallocated for defense is where the\ndivision happens pensions and salaries\nthe revenue is one account we don't\nstill about 52% of the yeah we don't we\ndon't include that it may be 52% of the\nTotal Defense budget no that's that's a\ncommitted one and we sincerely believe\nit should be where it is got to be and\nafter that is when you're looking at\nreplenishing the\nexisting lifespan of a particular Vector\nlife lifespan of a particular long-term\nasset and then looking at just the\ncomponents and so and then within that\nyou're looking at how much is Army how\nmuch is Navy how much is Air Force how\nmuch is Coast Guard so it is not as if\nwe blindly give one chunk of amount and\nsay sorry that's the end of the story\nyou can do now what we placed emphasis\nin this vot on account is to make\nInnovation driven procurement and\nManufacturing within India for atbar\ndefense so you're driving money towards\ngreater Innovation within the country\nthat you're able to produce those\nequipments which are critical for you\nwithin India for that I made a separate\nallocation so it is now a lot more\ncalibrated to the needs of each one of\nthem it's not blank and give money do\nwhat you want one of the big\ndevelopments in the international money\nmarkets this year will be when JP Morgan\nincludes Indian government bonds in the\nuh Government Bond index for emerging\nmarkets from June uh we we've seen that\nyou've reduced the fiscal deficit from\nthe projected 5.9 to 5.8 now hoping to\nbring this down to\n5.1 how much how important is it for you\nto send a message to International\nrating agencies to improve India's\ncredit rating at this moment and how are\nyou looking at this inclusion and all\nthe billions of dollars that flow into\nIndia after this see there are two\ndifferent things going into JP Morgan's\nlisting is one thing you are going to\nget money which is going to be less\ncostly\nand it'll be almost a default setup that\nit'll keep coming once it is in the list\nand so\non that's one side yes it'll enable that\nprocess from June let us say but the\nother is about the credit rating\nagencies am I bringing down the fiscal\ndeficit from 5.9 where it was expected\nto be to 5.8 because I want a better\nperspective shared with the F no it can\ncan be so it can be a collateral but I'm\nmore aiming at getting India's Fisk a\nlot more primed up a lot more toned up\nso that it just carry too much of flab\nthat you're not able to at any point in\ntime take that kind of a you know\ndecision making or give commitments to\nbetter perform so discipline and fiscal\nmanagement is something which Prime\nMinister Modi takes very seriously even\nas a chief minister he's had a record\nshowing how he managed economy finances\nwithin Gujarat some of the states aren't\nfollowing this kind of an approach How\nconcerned are you by the kind of public\nindied we're seeing in some of the\nopposition it is concerning and we talk\nto them we try to sort of uh help them\nout to rearrange their uh uh fiscal But\nultimately it is the state's\nresponsibility we can only be the good\nCouncil we can't do anything more beyond\nthat but of course ultimately under\nConstitution's article 293 we we are\ngoing to have to take the final call and\nresponsibility on that but that is a\nvery delicate play because we can't\nencroach into the state's decision\nmaking Finance Minister soon after the\nbudget Moody's came out and taking this\npoint forward uh about our uh the rating\nOutlook and it said India's debt to GDP\nStill Remains High despite the fact that\nyou projected decline 58.1% to 57.2% in\nfi25 are rating agencies missing the the\npoint about the kind of fiscal\ntransformation that uh the Modi\ngovernment has been trying for the last\n10\nyears it's good that you're saying it\nand I've not said it but that's the\ntruth look at the borrowing debt to GDP\nnumber for developed\neconomies they are well beyond 200s and\n300s well over 100 any\ncase they're credit rating doesn't get\naffected by the debt to\nGDP so when mine is well below 100 at 80\nlet us say but if it matters to the\nrating agencies that my debt to GDP is\nnot above 100 I have no answers to give\nit is not above\n100 okay ma'am let's speak for a moment\nabout disinvestment you know you've got\nsome public sector unit uh companies\nwhich are different stages of\ndisinvestment there is no ambitious\nTarget for disinvestment there seems to\nbe a change in thinking so if you can\nexplain that and if and when you do come\nback to Power uh how important is\nstrategic disinvestment as one of the\nmissions for the Modi government and for\nyou personally as Finance Minister how\ncommitted are we still to trying to get\ngovernment out of companies which the\ngovernment really ought not to be\nrunning I'll start with the fact that\nI've stated it as a matter of\npolicy went through the parliament got\ngot approved and came out 2122 budget\nthat we do believe that all sectors\nshould be open for private participation\nno sector should be reserved for public\nsector only and even if public sectors\npresent in those core strategically\nimportant sectors they will be minimal\npresence I believe in it Prime Minister\nModi believes in it it is the policy\napproved by the parliament of India now\ntherefore for I will have to consolidate\nin those sectors public sector presence\nor I will where I can't amalgamate or\nbring together or scale up I will have\nto get out of some of them for which the\napproval is obtained I will have to do\nit but equally before I do it during the\ntime I'm waiting to do it I will have to\npay attention to the valuation of that\ncomp I can't allow it to languish and I\ncan't allow it to continue to languish\ntill before I throw them out or till\nbefore I get out of them and when I want\nto get out of them if I don't allow them\nto flourish in the meanwhile the\nvaluation that I obtain from the market\nis going to be trivial if anything at\nall so we have for one I want to be sure\nto tell the people of India even if I've\ntaken a call to disinvest a complete a\ncompany completely I'm a in to keep it\nin its prime condition now and that is\nwhy you find the public sector companies\nin the stock market now performing much\nbetter and giving better dividends to\nall the shareholders we can be some of\nit and others are also taking the\ndividend from it the other way of also\nlooking at if disinvestment is happening\nis when we have come down in the level\nof holding that I have further letting\nit into the market so that r\nuh investors would come in so the level\nto which I hold my shares in a public\npublic sector company also is something\nwhich you have to observe because I'm\nslowly coming down in terms of the level\nto which I'm holding shares in these my\nquestion m' was about as far as a core\ntenant of belief is concerned how\nimportant is strategic disinvestment for\nyou personally and for this government\nat this moment polic the manner because\nwe saw India happened quite seamlessly\nand you were able to get it out but we\nare we aren't really seeing the same\nsense of pace and urgency when it comes\nto some of the other disinvestment\nprojects are currently in the pipeline\nand I'm kind of wondering when you see\nglad to hear this from you Rahul before\nAir India I was Piller when is it\nhappening when is it happening every\ntime I met with a journalist friend this\nwould be the question and at that time\nit looked as if I'm sitting over it over\na\ncentury I'm glad to hear that now no as\nI said it will will happen our\ncommitments will be fulfilled and the\ncore belief that you keep asking me\nabout that is why I went back to tell\nyou that it is this government which\nwent to the parliament to say\ndisinvestment is what we believe in\nbecause other than the core sectors\nthere's no way in which we need to be\npresent as government and in the core\nsectors it is because of strategic\ninterest Telecom unless I'm there I\nwon't be able to cover my first Villages\nwhich are now called vibrant villages\nprivate sector wouldn't go there but how\nwould I give give them connectivity I\nneed to be there Railways I need to be\nthere like that our belief is to have\nminimal PRS uh FM just one quick follow\nup on that is the market and other\nanalysts missing the point that the\ndividends that come to you from Central\npublic sector undertakings or for the\nmatter RBI which has helped contain the\nfiscal deficit in this budget's\ncalculation as well that is also Al in\nsome ways revenue from the assets that\nhave been built by the ex the market\nknow it it is you journalists who want\nto go asking me this question okay enjoy\nit I'll I'll come to another point and\nthis is to do with the north south\nnarrative that uh keeps happening two\nquestions there and just to add uh data\nhere the tax Devolution in fi 24 ma'am\nthat you announced and we have seen that\nRose\n16% Central transfers are equally high\nat\n15% yet there is this north south\nnarrative and some voices from the south\nseem to suggest that the south is\ngetting a raw deal it contributes more\nto tax Collections and the north takes\nit away how would you respond to that\nit's entirely politically M\nmotivated not backed by by facts or data\nand above all very\ndivisionary and encourage sist\nelements it is being done deliberately\nis my allegation I charge them with that\nthey're doing it\ndeliberately if that is the case that we\nwant to talk about look at the\nInvestments that are going to the South\nnot private\ngovernments why does the government of\nIndia invest then it is because country\nas a whole will have to leverage the\nstrengths that exist in the\ncountry from one area one strength\nminerals material all of them come do we\nthen allow that area to say without me\ngiving you coal without me giving you I\nknow nothing will move so give me the\nentire earning is that the way we look\nat\nit\nthen if that is the way we have to look\nat regions which give higher\nRevenue within a developed state which\nsays I contribute so much Maharashtra\ncontributes a lot more can it say that\ngive me that much one second even within\nKarnataka where the honorable deputy\nchief Minister's brother has said look\nwe are not getting as much as we giving\nso it might mean that we'll have to form\na separate country out of South India\nI'd like to ask him bangaluru\ncontributes to karnataka's income much\ndisproportionately higher now if all\ncitizens of bangaluru say look we want\nto be a separate country man be damned\nwith your\nkala be damned with your chraa what will\nthe government say there which is now in\npower which is Congress comment the same\ncan be for\nMumbai in Maharashtra Mumbai can say\nsorry it's all my money H Mumbai becomes\na separate country you go VBA be your\nown Marat be your own are we okay with\nthat kind of language are we okay with\nthat kind of a thought somewhere in the\nback of our\nminds it's UT\nirresponsible and above all I think it's\ndone with a purpose to bring in that\nelement of you know doubt in the minds\nof people who live in these regions to\nsay oh probably the government is\ncheating us it's not giving us us a du\nare you a elected responsible leader\nsitting in the Lo SAA and there are few\nothers like\nthat believing in the constitution of\nIndia are you speaking responsibly\nis this the narrative you want to put\nforth in the\npublic and is it true narrative if it is\ntrue I can then say yeah you're speaking\nthe truth we'll have to look into\nit is this the\ntruth where does it lead us\nto utterly irresponsible but I think\nthis is the trend with which the\ncongress party is growing in the last 10\nto 20 years we are seeing repetition of\nthe tu tu sympathies within the Congress\nthey went and stood in jnu with that\ngang which wanted to break\nIndia they are now speaking this\nlanguage from the south they're\nsupporting parties which speak sist\nlanguage the DMK for instance they\nsupport them in Tamil Nadu they speak\nthat\nlanguage so what is this are we here by\nthe\nConstitution or are we different\nelements of breaking\nIndia ma' there's been some conversation\nabout senior ministers in the Modi\ncabinet fighting a Lo SAA election while\nof course that's something the party\nwill decide would you like to put your\nhand up and say give me a seat somewhere\nin Tamil NAD or wherever it is that you\nprefer which state would you prefer to\nfight from probably tamad in my\nunderstanding and would you like to do\nit would you relish the prospect of\ngetting out of North block fighting a\nloab election you know party like BJP\nit's not the person who reles to do a BC\nit is a party which says okay now you do\nthis and you may also want to relish it\nand we follow it but would you relish\nthat challenge moving from the party\nsays right okay now ma'am you know there\nwas an interview that I did with\nProfessor auram Rajan at Davos and I've\nbeen wanting to ask you this question\nsince his larger point was that the\ngovernment the Modi government at this\nmoment makes it seem as if we're on a 7%\ngrowth path and that this is relative to\nwhat's happening in the world very good\nhe says given our stage of economic\nEvolution we should really be aiming for\n9 10 % he chided me to ask government\nwhen I got a chance uh that you know\nthis is actually our current growth\nprospects and forecast are 2 or 3%\nlesser than what you said while you were\nin opposition and his charge is that\njust because we can't find the ways of\ngrowing at 9 to 10% the government is\nnow making it seem as if 7% is the best\nthat can be done look at China at a\nsimilar stage of its Evolution cycle\nlook at the Spirit which they were\ngrowing if India does intend to become a\nvixi country we need to be growing at 9\n10% how would you respond to raguram\nRaj I would want to ask you should I\nrespond to him as raguram Rajan The\nEconomist or raguram Rajan the\npolitician the answer will depend on\nit no I want to say this first that's an\nanswer that I'm giving\nyou because raguram Rajan also had told\nus that we shouldn't invest anymore in\nmanufacturing concentrate on\nservices but when he wants to talk on\nChina he would compare China has always\ninterested hugely in manufacturing now\nI'm not imitating China we'll have to\nfind ways in which our own strengths can\nbe further\nleveraged so that is one advice\nearlier so I find it difficult to take\nraguram rajan's advice also because he\nwas here holding a very responsible\nposition as governor of Reserve Bank of\nIndia the banks went through torment\na\nregulator looked the other way then\nphone calls were going to the banks and\nBanks were yielding to the phone calls\nthe regulator didn't tell them you will\nyield only to the banking norms and not\nto phone\ncalls so raguram Rajan make up your mind\nwhen you speak to the government and\nnudging the media to go ask the\ngovernment questions say first of all\nlook I'm now wearing my Economist hat\nand sometimes I'm wearing my political\nhat that might be easy for us to address\nFinance Minister many decades ago and I\ngrew up and millions of Indians grew up\nwith the Roti Kapa makan slogan and in\nthe last 10 years of Modi nomics Roti\nthrough the uh free food scheme for 800\nmillion plus people and now this budget\nannouncing more expansion as far as\nhousing is concerned all also a new\nscheme for middle class housing\nhopefully to address people who are on\nrent the Capa is missing or should we\nlook forward for another word instead of\nKapa in the RO Kapa makan phrase no Kapa\nis not missing Kapa is something which\nthe family can choose to do if they are\notherwise benefited in terms of the\nbasic\nnecessities so it's not as if you're\ngoing to take care of food but not\nclothe no if that individual and his\nfamily is empowered enough he they'll\ntake a call on how they want to spend\ntheir money instead of I mean like I\nwouldn't want to quote ma but wasn't it\nMa who said look no good helping him to\nfish today giving a fish in his hand\ngive him the skills to fish he will be\nable to we are aiming at provide the\nbasic facility then give him access to\ndifferent opportunities he wants to do\nhis own business don't stifle him by\nsaying get me a collateral then I'll\nlend you no collateral I'll lend you do\nyour business similarly if they are in\nvillages wanting more technology into\nthe fields we are giving the drones we\nare training them so go do it\nsimultaneously looking at the gender\nparity and so on\nso aim of this government is to empower\nthe person to make his own decision so\nis it Ro Kapa Finance because this\nbudget is also announced a long-term\nscheme for\nfinancing financing has already happened\nit's continuing to happen mudra Swan are\nall financing so that will continue also\nwe will enable people who have\naspirations to become entrepreneurs to\nget assistance from the banks M we're\ncoming towards the end of this interview\nyou've now presented six budgets I want\nyour sense of how you see your Evolution\nas Finance Minister from year one to\nyear six everybody has their own take\nand there's so many pink papers writing\nconstantly about every move you make but\nwhen you look at the mirror and reflect\nhow how do you think you've evolved as\nan economist as a finance minister as an\nindividual as a politician over these\nsix years gosh that that's very many I\ncan't answer all of\nthem uh well it's been u a challenge and\nalso an opportunity to work in such an\nenvironment and uh it's not just saying\nit I I honestly do feel very much from\nthe bottom of my heart to have a leader\nunder in the name of Prime Minister Modi\nand work with\nthem I've worked in corporate\nenvironments earlier the level of\nprofessional the level\nof\ntask tasking an individual and making\nsure that performance is the only\ncriteria professionalism in work and\nmaking sure that till the last minute if\nguidance and handholding is required it\nis provided being objective being we\nneed to deliver we need to deliver so\nthat sense of working in a team with the\nguidance of the right kind of you know\nassistance and not\npatronage is immensely satisfying Raa\nmantal or with mantal if you had to\npick both were great and and there was\nCommerce as well and commerce as well\nand I've been very fortunate in that my\nparty and my prime minister have given\nme opportunities to serve in each one of\nthese responsibilities this has been a\nbroad ranging interview for your\nresponses and for your time and for your\nfiscal discipline in an election cycle\nuh which is as rare as rare can be and\nthat's something that's now being looked\nat internationally Finance Minister\nthank you so much for speaking to India\ntoday and business thank you very\nappreciate it let's see if you're back\nin July you've almost indicated that\nI'll be back\nthis government will be B who will be\nwhere I cannot that's not my it's much\nbeyond my P Grant thank you so much for\nyour time appreciate thank\nyou hello and welcome the most obvious\nimpulse of any Finance Minister heading\ninto an election cycle is to roll out\nthe populist red carpet and yet Finance\nMinister nirmala sitaraman chose fiscal\nPrudence does this reflect a sense of\nconfidence about the Modi government\ncoming back to power a third time is she\nsending a market to signal to the\ninternational bond markets and what's\nthe economic Outlook from the finance\nMinister's perspective from here on to\ntalk about all of this we're joined at\nthe North block at the finance\nMinister's office by six-time budget\npresenter Nala sitaraman Finance\nMinister welcome and thank you for your\ntime this Minister by my colleague\nbusiness the television's managing\neditor sidat zarabi ma'am I want to\nstart by getting you to talk about the\ncomparison between this interim budget\nand the last couple of interim budgets\nwhich happened just before the\nannouncement of Elections there was\nalways a lot of populism you chose to\nstay away from that are you deliberately\nsending out a message that I'll be back\nin July and I'll do what I need to at\nthat time I don't need to do anything\nright\nnow well the message about us coming\nback is the way in which you all\nreporting about things how the\ngovernment has performed how in the last\n10 years those promises which were given\nwere\nfulfilled\nand on the ground actually people are\nactually speaking about the work of this\ngovernment and not a whisper of\ncorruption so that's the message which\npeople are themselves giving Which you\nthe media carrying but I've taken the\ninterim budget as an interim\nbudget and asking for a wot on account\njust to keep the business going of the\ngovernment is what it is meant for done\nonly that when you do a temperature\ncheck of the Indian economy what is it\nthat gives you the greatest reason for\noptimism and what is it that's giving\nyou nightmare or the most concern at\nthis\nmoment\num the optimism bit is because the power\nof the word of\nmouth people who have benefited from\ngovernment's\npromises are speaking about it\nthemselves and they are cross the board\nthey don't belong to any one section one\nregion one state one language one\nreligion they are all\nover and that gives trust in people's\nmind people trust you will probably\ntrust your friends your neighbors your\npeers your colleagues rather than\ntrusting a political leader by Nature\nIndia is like that and therefore when\npeople say yes I've also got a house\nhere's the paper I've got the gas\nconnection what has come to my uh\ntap and my sons are or daughters are\ngetting skills they are getting\nrecruited they going into you know Armed\nForces Med colleges signic schools so\nthat power of that word of mouth among\nbeneficiaries or potential beneficiaries\nis the one which makes me feel that\npeople realize this is a government\nproom which promises and delivers and\nthe prime minister is absolutely seized\nof everything that is happening in the\nground\nthat is one confidence the other\nconfidence try as they may the\nopposition in the their rulle states as\nwell have not matched this kind of\nperformance and top it all with no one\ngetting any personal pecary\nbenefit not one scandal in 10\nyears the image of India fragile five\npolicy paralysis corruption at every\nlevel it's changed in 10\nyears you think people of India don't\nrecognize that so that's the confidence\nChallenge and worry you yeah Challenge\nand worry more external Wars abroad you\nknow uncertainty in the red sea fish\nMarine Lines getting\naffected Transportation Supply Chain\ndisruptions those I think in the last 3\n4 years if you can say with sense of\nconfidence\nuncertainty has become the rule of the\ngame we have to live with it we have to\nfactor in for it since you speak about\nliving with uncertainty and factoring it\nin 10 years of modomics and you said no\nscandals why the need for a white paper\nuh on the state of the economy that the\nModi government inherited why\nnow prime minister himself has spoken\nabout in 2015 or 16 he said then that\nthere were a lot of people suggesting to\nhim that he'd come out with a white\npaper and he chose not to do it\nthen and he explain the reasons as was\navailable to him at that time he said no\nlook I'll put my nation first I don't\nwant to come up with a white paper which\nis going to reveal all that was left for\nus to inherit and that would only affect\nthe investors confidence it can affect\nthe trust that the government the people\nof India have in India's own\ninstitutions so it's not the best for me\nto do now so I won't do it\nnow but after 10 full\nyears and after 10 full years of us very\nclearly delivering on our\npromises taking Indian economy closer to\nbeing the third largest economy\nrealizing it probably within a year or\ntwo after we come back let us\nsay we are now in a safe position to say\nto the people of India\nthis is exactly what we inherited this\nis what it took for us to correct it and\nin 10 years if this is the level of\neffort we've put not just to restore it\nbut to take it to that\nheight it is this kind of a leadership\nand decision making which we've given\nyou in the last 10 years now that you\noted us so right time to bring it in I\nwould think there's a lot of\nconversation about what's going right I\nwant to use this opportunity to talk\nabout a couple of areas of concern one\nis on Rural consumption I was reading\nthe earnings reports of several of these\nfmcg companies which seem to suggest\ndepending on which company you look at\nat least a 20 to 30% decline in rural\nconsumption a lot of left leaning\neconomists use this to suggest that\nthere is a high level of rural distress\nas Finance Minister how do you look at\nthis concern that uh in the rural sector\nwhen it comes comes to consumption a lot\nof companies are actually seeing\ndistress how much of a concern is that\nfor you and how are you hoping to\naddress\nthis I wouldn't just put them aside I\nwouldn't say no I'm not worried about it\nand I wouldn't say that their studies\nare worth nothing no not at all I would\ncertainly give it my best of\nattention but I'm not sure it is that 20\n30% that you're talking about fmcg be\ncompanies do have um metrics which we\nneed to take seriously because it\nindicates quick buying of durable goods\nbut equally it is not correct to say\nthat\nrural distress is continuing because I\nthink there's a lot of shift in the way\nin which rural economy is now going\nthrough there's a lot of shift because\nmoney is going in in the name of you\nknow one or the other scheme to every\nfamily in the rural area I would dare\nsay this that there is no family left\nwithout getting at least one or the\nother scheme of the government so those\nwho deserve it rural economy is also\nlooking at a changing Paradigm in\nagriculture a lot of uh you know\ncommercial crops are coming in the\nlinkages through the E National\nagriculture Market even today there are\nmedia reports about how between\ndifferent markets in different regions\nbetter rate is\nactualized so farmers are now seeing\npotential for them to move to different\ncrops the emphasis given to the Shri the\nmillets the emphasis given to\nHorticulture is finding newer markets\nwithin their locality the urban centers\nclose by are benefiting by the\nHorticulture reaching them locally and\nin reasonable price price so really it's\nno longer wheat and rice economy it is a\nlot more of horticulture\nFisheries livestock is gaining a lot of\nattention also supported by the policy\nof the government SGS which are now into\nvalue addition in food and also with\nmechanization of\nAgriculture which is bringing the\nmonotony down not throwing people\nout themselves are becoming centers for\nbusiness agriculture let's say a\nFarmer's son or daughter sets up a\nbusiness for Lending Leasing and hiring\nout\nequipments companies are coming in Into\nThe Villages saying we not all of them\nwant tractors but holes trying to deweed\nevery such small agricultural equipment\nis now Finding Traction for which their\ntheir sons and daughters themselves are\nsetting up businesses so there's a lot\nhappening in rural area Finance Minister\nyou uh gave a very interesting uh\ndefinition definition of secularism and\nyou linked it to saturation of the\navailability of all government schemes\nexpand on that is that now uh the new\ndefinition that the Modi government is\npushing out for secularism because it's\na word that has drawn a lot of debate in\nthe past that's right and uh not just in\n24 elections even in 2019 by which time\nUla had reached good\nDimensions you had people belonging to\ndifferent communities particularly when\nyou talk of glass gas cylinders only\nwomen come forward to talk about it men\nthink it doesn't matter to them because\nultimately the food has reach the table\nhow does it matter whether it is being\ncooked in gas or anything else so men\ntend to talk less about it women come\nout to say yes I'm benefiting with the\ngas\ncylinder people who came out to say that\nuula has helped me to bring a clean air\nin my kitchen and I'm more efficient in\ngetting my food done belong to all\ncommunity\neven at that time it was observed by\nmedia observed by political observers\nthat Wala scheme's implementation has\nproven that every eligible person gets\nit not just the first charge going to\none particular section as it was\nnarrated once earlier by a prime\nminister so that litus test of te\nsecularism actually in action has been\nfelt even in 2019 now it's felt even\nmore so if secularism has to be\npracticed you don't need to Pander to\nreligious beliefs if you're able to\nacross the board give everybody\neverything you are indifferent to the\nperson's Faith or religion but making\nsure he or she is as good as the other\nnext\ndoor that's action secularism in action\nma'am let's spend a moment on household\nsavings which have been one of the\npillars of the Indian economy in Years\nGone by and now household savings are\nset to be at a five decad low uh at 5.1%\nhow how are you looking at the aspect of\nIndian households seeming to save much\nlesser than they have in past decades\nand is that something that you're okay\nwith is that something that concern\nnecessary conclusion you can arrive\nat households saving lesser than before\nno because as much as you talk about\nsmall savings and quote numbers on it\nthe only option that small saving or\npeople in middle classes had for saving\ntheir money and with some confidence was\nto put it in let's say post office\nsavings account which continues which is\ngood enough which can continue any\nlonger but you're also noticing since\n2020 that because of Greater\ntransparency and greater availability of\ninformation\npeople are able to see which are those\nperforming companies they're not even\ngoing through the route of mutual funds\nto understand how stock market performs\nsmall saving in the name of retail\nfunding is coming into the stock markets\nand coming through demat accounts which\nare unique so I'm not talking about the\nsame person doing five types of\nInvestments new demat accounts unique\ndemat accounts tell you probably many\nthings which went to post offices\ncame are coming now into the market so\npeople are finding newer revenues to\nsave and probably better returns are\nured in those routs since we speaking\nabout the markets uh the stock market\nregulator recently put out a word of\ncaution with regard to uh you know a lot\nof the trades that are happening are\nhappening in trading in the derivatives\nsegment in\nfendo do you share that uh note of\nconcern with regard to the nature of how\npeople are trading in the markets that\nwas uh much higher than what it is now I\nwould think my concern that is much\nhigher earlier than it is now because\nthere's a lot of awareness being built\nby Regulators to say that uh derivatives\nand dealing in fno as you said can have\ninvolve high risk and many people burnt\ntheir fingers uh by starting to operate\nthere young people who were the\nfirsttime entrance also burnt their\nfingers so there was a lot of discussion\nabout it in one of our FS DC\nmeetings uh Regulators are now building\na lot of awareness and uh I would think\nthat caution has come into play now\nFinance Minister how are you you've been\nchiding India Inc to go out and invest\nto find the strength of Hanuman and to\ninvest in the India story and for\nvarious reasons the kind of secular\ninvestment cycle that you were hoping\nfor hasn't really kickstarted you can\nsee some green shoots in some sectors\nbut it's not an overall investment cycle\nuh how are you viewing because I I we\nwere together at the rraa bavan and you\nwere telling a member of India Inc to go\nout and invest even further how are you\nlooking at India Inc in several sectors\nstill being in wait and watch mode\nassessing but not committing fully to\ninvest at this moment is that now\nbeginning to get a little frustrating\nfor you how are you looking at\ninvestment appetite and actual\nInvestments apart from just the talk but\nuh I would equally say that in those\nSunrise sectors which for which we've\nannounced P schemes and so\non you find private investment coming in\nand coming in in significant numbers so\nI really cannot say now as I said\nearlier that hey you are anuma Hanuman\nyou start flying it is happening now and\nI would think they are very clear in\ntheir heads that their Investments now\nwill probably go through the the newest\nsectors and they may want to build\ncapacities add capacities to the\nexisting areas of activity but many of\nthem are now looking at prospects in the\nnewer areas so it is happening but\nhappening much more in the newer Sunrise\nsectors Finance Minister U two key\ninstruments of the government which have\nfocused on getting new manufacturing and\nprivate investment the point that was\njust made one of those schemes of 2019\nthe end date is 31st March 2024 the\nconcessional 15% trade for new\nmanufacturing uh companies along with\nthat you've given a host of PL schemes\ntwo parts to the question one do you see\nthe need for continuing with that lower\n15% rate eventually perhaps in the full\nbudget and\nsecond uh does PL scheme need to expand\nor at some point of time the government\nwill say we supported you as much as we\ncould now go on and do it on your\nown uh the answer to your second\nquestion is is not uh we've done it for\na few years so stop it now it's more to\nensure that India gets that lead in\nthose sectors in the sunrise areas so I\nwouldn't time it by saying I've done it\nfor 2 years shut shot now that that will\nnot be my Approach my Approach would be\nis it really getting rooted in India is\nit sustainable and are these industries\nreally you know taking off so those will\nbe my measure before I take a call on\nthat so I w't rush to say I've done it\nfor 2 years the other is about uh\nthe reduced tax\nrates as I said for many other things\nthis interim budget was not the time for\nme to take a call on that so I'm not\ntaken one of the critics we've heard\nfrom the opposition finance minister is\nthat when it comes to social sectors the\npercentage of government outlays on\neducation on health has come down as a\npercentage of our GDP in in the years\nthat this government has been on power\nthey level the acquisition that while\nyou're very focused on public\ninfrastructure uh that the amount of\nmoney that should be set aside for\neducation and for healthcare isn't\nadequate and even the outlays that are\nbeing made are not being fully spent\nwe're actually spending lesser than we\nprovisioned for how do you look at this\non the outlay not getting spent I may\nnot be the best person to answer I'll be\nconcerned as to why the outlays are not\ngetting spent but it it will be the\nDepartments and in particularly health\nand education States also have a role it\nis a concurrent list of items that we\ntalking about when we talk about\neducation and health so it will depend\non how much absorption Happ happens in\nthe states how much the department is\nable to push and so on so those factors\nare totally out of my realm but I can\nunderstand where they are and probably a\nlonger discussion can happen only on\nthose two uh issues um it's also not\nright to measure expenditure on\neducation and health as being adequate\nor not adequate it can never be adequate\nI'll concede that any amount that I put\nfor Education will still think I mean\nyou'll think I'll think anybody will\nfeel more can be added and yes more can\nbe added there cannot be a second\nthought on that but the fact remains as\nI said also for one question earlier\nsomewhere else about capital expenditure\nthis time being not % in increase only\n11%\nincrease there's after all a element\nwhich is called absorption capacity you\ncan put ton loads of money somewhere and\nthe in the capex our condition was you\nuse it within 12 months I'll give you\nnext year but use what I've given you\nnow fully this year the absorption\ncapacity element makes many of them who\ngenuinely want to spend it after a point\nnot able to throttle it down within 12\nmonths they would need 13 14 15th month\nalso but I'm sorry within 12 month it\nhasn't happened fully so is the case\nwith education and health you may want\nto put any number into the\noutlay but eventually unless there's a\nproperly fitted Hospital you're not\ngoing to be able to give additional\ntraining to the staff and spend money on\nthat unless you have more medical seats\navailable you're not going to have\nenough doctors coming into the hospital\nhital unless again it is spread all over\nthe country that's why at one point in\ntime I remember during my Atma nbar\nannouncements we said no longer are we\nlooking at District level hospital now\nit has to go to the Block Level so there\nare levels and levels to which we need\nto now pad with more efforts and\nresources so it's not going to happen\nwithin one year suppose I say I'm giving\nmore enough this year of the\nGDP are they in a position to absorb the\nfirst layer is being set second third\nand so on I can't pop at the fifth level\nwhen these have not been done Finance\nMinister since we are speaking about\nallocations um explain the philosophy on\nthe defense allocation you've been\ndefense minister you've been Commerce\nMinister and defense still about 6 lakh\nCR the highest allocation but some\npeople say it's still 4.72% year on-year\ngrowth uh earlier than that in the\nprevious Financial year there was a\nsubstantial increase what's the\nphilosophy behind the defense budget\nallocation first of all defense and\ntheir procurement you know it coming\nfrom a defense background uh your friend\nRahul will know it we shared that\nbackground yes the\nlong-term perspective planning that the\ndefense has is really long time and they\ngo on fitting every year towards\nachieving that long-term\ngoal and for each year it's not a\nproportionate allocation towards that\nlong term sometime it's more sometimes\nit's less sometimes it's just about all\nright and so on so it is the end goal\nthat your long-term perspective plan\nwhich has to be achieved and in the\nprocess the allocations keep going up\nand down in order that we get a complete\npicture of how money is got to be\nallocated for defense is where the\ndivision happens pensions and salaries\nthe revenue is one account we don't in\nstill about 52% of the we don't we don't\ninclude that it may be 52% of the Total\nDefense budget no that's that's a\ncommitted one and we sincerely believe\nit should be where it has got to be and\nafter that is when you're looking at\nreplenishing the\nexisting lifespan of a particular Vector\nlife lifespan of a particular long-term\nasset and then looking at just the\ncomponents and so and then within that\nyou're looking at how much is Army how\nmuch is Navy how much is Air Force how\nmuch is Coast Guard so so it is not as\nif we blindly give one chunk of amount\nand say sorry that's the end of the\nstory you can do now what we placed\nemphasis in this vote on account is to\nmake Innovation driven procurement and\nManufacturing within India for atanur\ndefense so you're driving money towards\ngreater Innovation within the country\nthat you able to produce those\nequipments which are critical for you\nwithin India for that I made a separate\nallocation so it is now a lot more\ncalibrated to the needs of each one of\nthem it's not blanket give money do what\nyou want one of the big developments in\nthe international money markets this\nyear will be when JP Morgan includes\nIndian government bonds in the uh\nGovernment Bond index for emerging\nmarkets from June uh we've seen that\nyou've reduced the fiscal deficit from\nthe projected 5.9 to 5.8 now hoping to\nbring this down to 5.1\nhow much how important is it for you to\nsend a message to International rating\nagencies to improve India's credit\nrating at this moment and how are you\nlooking at this inclusion and all the\nbillions of dollars that flow into India\nafter this see there are two different\nthings going into JP Morgans listing is\none thing you are going to get money\nwhich is going to be less\ncostly and it'll be almost a default\nsetup that it'll keep coming once it is\nin the list and so on\nthat's one side yes it'll enable that\nprocess from June let us say but the\nother is about the credit rating\nagencies am I bringing down the fiscal\ndeficit from 5.9 where it was expected\nto be to 5.8 because I want a better\nperspective shared with the F no it can\nbe so it can be a collateral but I'm\nmore aiming at getting India's Fisk a\nlot more more primed up a lot more toned\nup so that it just carry too much of\nflab that you're not able to at any\npoint in time take that kind of a you\nknow decision making or give commitments\nto better perform so discipline in\nfiscal management is something which\nPrime Minister Modi takes very seriously\neven as a chief minister he's had a\nrecord showing how he managed economy\nfinances within Gujarat some of the\nstates aren't following this kind of an\napproach How concerned are you by the\nkind of public indied we're seeing in\nsome of the opposition it is concerning\nand we talk to them we try to sort of uh\nhelp them out to rearrange their uh uh\nfiscal But ultimately it is the state's\nresponsibility we can only be the good\nCouncil we can't do anything more beyond\nthat but of course ultimately under\nConstitution's article 293 we are going\nto have to take the final call and\nresponsibility on that but that is a\nvery delicate play because we can't\nencroach into this State's decision\nmaking Finance Minister soon after the\nbudget Moody's came out and taking this\npoint forward uh about our the rating\nOutlook and it said India's debt to GDP\nStill Remains High despite the fact that\nyou projected decline 58.1% to 57.2% in\nfi25 are rating agencies missing the\npoint about the kind of fiscal\ntransformation that uh the Modi\ngovernment has been trying for the last\n10 years\nit's good that you're saying it and I've\nnot said it but that's the\ntruth look at the borrowing debt to GDP\nnumber for developed\neconomies they are well beyond 200s and\n300s well over 100 any\ncase their credit rating doesn't get\naffected by the debt to\nGDP so when mine is well with below 100\nat 80 let us say but if it matters to\nthe rating agencies that my debt to GDP\nis not above 100 I have no answers to\ngive it is not above\n100 okay ma'am let's speak for a moment\nabout disinvestment you know you've got\nsome public sector unit uh companies\nwhich are different stages of\ndisinvestment there is no ambitious\nTarget for disinvestment there seems to\nbe a change in thinking so if you can\nexplain that and if and when you do come\nback to Power uh how important is\nstrategic disinvestment as one of the\nmissions for the Modi government and for\nyou personally as Finance Minister how\ncommitted are we still to trying to get\ngovernment out of companies which the\ngovernment really ought not to be\nrunning I'll start with the fact that\nI've stated it as a matter of\npolicy went through the parliament got\napproved and came out 2122 budget that\nwe do believe that all sector should be\nopen for private participation no sector\nshould be reserved for public sector\nonly and even if public sector is\npresent in those core strategically\nimportant sectors they will be minimal\npresence I believe in it Prime Minister\nModi believes in it it is the policy\napproved by the parliament of India now\ntherefore I will have to consolidate in\nthose sectors public sector presence or\nI will where I can't amalgamate or bring\ntogether or scale up I will have to get\nout of some of them for which the\napproval is obtained I will have to do\nit but equally before I do it during the\ntime I'm waiting to do it I will have to\npay attention to the valuation of that\nconf I can't allow it to languish and I\ncan't allow it to continue to languish\ntill before I throw them out or till\nbefore I get out out of them and when I\nwant to get out of them if I don't allow\nthem to flourish in the meanwhile the\nvaluation that I obtain from the market\nis going to be trivial if anything at\nall so we have for one I want to be sure\nto tell the people of India even if I've\ntaken a call to disinvest a complete a\ncompany completely I'm attending to keep\nit in its prime condition now and that\nis why you find the public sector\ncompanies in the stock market now\nperforming much better and giving better\ndividends to all the shareholders we can\nbe some of it and others are also taking\nthe dividend from it the other way of\nalso looking at if disinvestment is\nhappening is when we have come down in\nthe level of holding that I have further\nletting it into the market so that\nretail uh investors would come in so the\nlevel to which I hold my shares is in a\npublic public sector company also is\nsomething which you have to observe\nbecause I'm slowly coming down in terms\nof the level to which I'm holding shares\nin these my question M was about as far\nas a core tenant of belief is concerned\nhow important is strategic disinvestment\nfor you personally and for this\ngovernment at this moment the manner in\nbecause we saw Air India happen quite\nseamlessly and you were able to get it\nout but we are we aren't really seeing\nthe same sense of pace and urgency when\nit comes to some of the other\ndisinvestment projects are currently in\nthe pipeline and I'm kind of wondering\nwhen you see glad to hear this from you\nRahul before Air India I was pillared\nwhen is it happening when is it\nhappening every time I met with a\njournalist friend this would be the\nquestion and at that time it looked as\nif I'm sitting over it over a\ncentury I'm glad to hear that now no as\nI said it will happen our commitments\nwill be fulfilled and the core belief\nthat you keep asking me about that is\nwhy I went back to tell you that that it\nis this government which went to the\nparliament to say disinvestment is what\nwe believe in because other than the\ncore sectors there's no way in which we\nneed to be present as government and in\nthe core sectors it is because of\nstrategic interest telom unless I'm\nthere I wouldn't be able to cover my\nfirst Villages which are now called\nvibrant Villages private sector wouldn't\ngo there but how would I give give them\nconnectivity I need to be there Railways\nI need to be there\nlike that our belief is to have minimal\npresents uh FM just one quick follow up\non that is the market and other analysts\nmissing the point that the dividends\nthat come to you from Central public\nsector undertakings or for the matter\nRBI which has helped contain the fiscal\ndeficit in this budget's calculation as\nwell that is also in some ways revenue\nfrom the assets that have been built by\nthe ex Market know it it is you\njournalists who want to go ask me this\nquestion okay enjoy it I'll I'll come to\nanother point and this is to do with the\nnorth south narrative that uh keeps\nhappening two questions there and just\nto add uh data here the tax Devolution\nin f524 ma'am that you announced and we\nhave seen that Rose\n16% Central transfers are equally high\nat\n15% yet there is this north south\nnarrative and some voices from the south\nseem to suggest that the South is\ngetting a raw deal it contributes more\nto tax Collections and the north takes\nit away how would you respond to that\nit's entirely politically M\nmotivated not backed by by facts or data\nand above all very\ndivisionary and encourage sist elements\nit is being done deliberately is my\nallegation I charge them with that\nthey're doing it deliberately\nif that is the case that we want to talk\nabout look at the Investments that are\ngoing to the South not private\ngovernments why does the government of\nIndia invest then it is because country\nas a whole will have to leverage the\nstrengths that exist in the\ncountry from one area one strength\nminerals material all of them come do we\nthen allow that area to say without me\ngiving you C\nwithout me giving you I or nothing will\nmove so give me the entire earning is\nthat the way we look at\nit\nthen if that is the way we have to look\nat regions which give higher\nRevenue within a developed state which\nsays I contribute so much Maharashtra\ncontributes a lot more can it say that\ngive me that much one second even within\nKarnataka where the The Honorable deputy\nchief Minister's brother has said look\nwe are not getting as much as we giving\nso it might mean that we'll have to form\na separate country out of South India\nI'd like to ask him bangaluru\ncontributes to karnataka's income much\ndisproportionately higher now if all\ncitizens of bangaluru say look we want\nto be a separate country man be damned\nwith your kalaraka be damned with your\nchraa what will the government say there\nwhich is now in public which is Congress\ngovernment the same can be for\nMumbai in Maharashtra Mumbai can say\nsorry it's all my money Mumbai becomes a\nseparate country you go VBA be your own\nMarat be your own are we okay with that\nkind of language are we okay with that\nkind of a thought somewhere in the back\nof our\nminds it's utterly\nirresponsible and above all I think it's\ndone with a purpose to bring in that\nelement of you know doubt in the minds\nof people who live in these regions to\nsay oh probably the government is\ncheating us it's not giving us us a du\nare you a elected responsible leader\nsitting in the Lo saaba and there are\nfew others like\nthat believing in the constitution of\nIndia are you speaking\nresponsibly is this the narrative you\nwant to put forth in the\npublic and is it true narrative if it is\ntrue I can then say yeah you're speaking\nthe truth we'll have to look into\nit is this the\ntruth where does it lead us\nto utterly irresponsible but I think\nthis is the trend with which the\ncongress party is growing in the last 10\nto 20 years we are seeing repetition of\nthe TU to sympathies within the Congress\nthey went and stood in J with that gang\nwhich wanted to break in\nIndia they are now speaking this\nlanguage from the south they're\nsupporting parties which speak sist\nlanguage the DMK for instance they\nsupport them in Tamil Nadu they speak\nthat\nlanguage so what is this are we here by\nthe\nConstitution or are we different\nelements of break\nIndia ma' there's been some conversation\nabout senior ministers in the Modi\ncabinet fighting a l OFA election while\nof course that's something the party\nwill decide would you like to put your\nhand up and say give me a seat somewhere\nin Tamil NAD or wherever it is that you\nprefer which state would you prefer to\nfight from probably Tamil NAD in my\nunderstanding and would you like to do\nit would you relish the prospect of\ngetting out of North block fighting a\nloab election you know party like BJP\nit's not the person who religious to do\na BC it is the party which says okay now\nyou do this and you may also want to\nrelish it and we follow it but would you\nrelish that challenge moving from the\nparty says right\nokay now ma'am you know there was an\ninterview that I did with Professor\nauram Rajan at Davos and I've been\nwanting to ask you this question since\nhis larger point was that the government\nthe Modi government at this moment makes\nit seem as if we're on a 7% growth path\nand that this is relative to what's\nhappening in the world very good he says\ngiven our stage of economic Evolution we\nshould really be aiming for 9 10% he\nchided me to ask government when I got a\nchance uh that you know this is actually\nour current growth prospects and\nforecast 2 or 3% lesser than what you\nsaid while you were in opposition and\nhis charge is that just because we can't\nfind the ways of growing at 9 to 10% the\ngovernment is now making it seem as if\n7% is the best that can be done look at\nChina at a similar stage of its\nEvolution cycle look at the Spirit which\nthey were growing if India does intend\nto become a vixit country we need to be\ngrowing at 9 10% how would you respond\nto raguram\nRaj I would want to ask you should I\nrespond to him as raguram Rajan The\nEconomist or raguram Rajan the\npolitician\nthe answer will depend on\nit no I want to say this first that's an\nanswer that I'm giving\nyou because raguram Rajan also had told\nus that we shouldn't invest anymore in\nmanufacturing concentrate on\nservices but when he wants to talk on\nChina he would compare China has always\ninterested hugely in manufacturing now\nI'm not imitating China we'll have to\nfind ways in which our own strengths can\nbe further\nleveraged so that is one advice\nearlier so I find it difficult to take\nraguram rajan's advice also because he\nwas here holding a very responsible\nposition as governor of Reserve Bank of\nIndia the banks went through\ntorment a\nregulator looked the other way then\nphone call were going to the banks and\nBanks were yielding to the phone calls\nthe regulator didn't tell them you will\nyield only to the banking norms and not\nthe phone\ncalls so raguram Rajan make up your mind\nwhen you speak to the government and\nnudging the media to go ask the\ngovernment questions say first of all\nlook I'm now wearing my Economist hat\nand sometimes I'm wearing my political\nhat that might be easy for us to address\nFinance Minister many decades ago and I\ngrew up and millions of Indians grew up\nwith the Roti Kara Magan slogan and in\nthe last 10 years of modomics Roti\nthrough the uh free food scheme for 800\nmillion plus people and now this budget\nannouncing more expansion as far as\nhousing is concerned also a new scheme\nfor middle class housing hopefully to\naddress people who are on rent the Capa\nis missing or should should we look\nforward for another word instead of Kapa\nin the RO Kapa makan phrase no Kapa is\nnot missing Kapa is something which the\nfamily can choose to do if they are\notherwise benefited in terms of the\nbasic\nnecessities so it's not as if you're\ngoing to take care of food but not\nclothed no if that individual and his\nfamily is empowered enough he they'll\ntake a call on how they want to spend\ntheir money\ninstead of I mean like I wouldn't want\nto quote ma but wasn't it Ma who said\nlook no good helping him to fish today\ngiving him fish in his hand give him the\nskills to fish he will be able to we are\naiming at provide the basic facility\nthen give him access to different\nopportunities he wants to do his own\nbusiness don't stifle him by saying get\nme a collateral then I'll lend you no\ncollateral I'll lend you do your\nbusiness similarly if they are in\nvillages wanting more technology into\nthe fields we are giving the drones we\nare training them so go do it\nsimultaneously looking at the gender\nparity and so on\nso aim of this government is to empower\nthe person to make his own decision so\nis it Ro Kapa Finance because this\nbudget is also announced a long-term\nscheme for\nfinancing financing has already happened\nit's continu to happen mudra Swan are\nall financing so that will continue also\nwe will enable people who have\naspirations to become entrepreneurs to\nget assistance from the banks now we're\ncoming towards the end of this interview\nyou've now presented six budgets I want\nyour sense of how you see your Evolution\nas Finance Minister from year one to\nyear six everybody has their own take\nand there's so many pink papers writing\nconstantly about every move you make but\nwhen you look at the mirror and reflect\nhow how do you think you've evolved as\nan economist as a finance minister as an\nindividual as a politician over these\nsix years gosh that that's very many I\ncan't answer all of them\nat uh well it's been u a challenge and\nalso an opportunity to work in such an\nenvironment and uh it's not just saying\nit I honestly do feel very much from the\nbottom of my heart to have a leader\nunder in the name of prime minister m\nand work with\nhim I've worked in corporate\nenvironments earlier the level of\nprofessionals the level\nof\ntask tasking an individual and making\nsure that performance is the only\ncriteria professionalism in work and\nmaking sure that till the last minute if\nguidance and handholding is required it\nis provided being objective being we\nneed to de\nwe need to deliver so that sense of\nworking in a team with the guidance of\nthe right kind of you know assistance\nand not\npatronage is immensely\nsatisfying Raa mantal or with mantal if\nyou had to\npick both were great and and there was\nCommerce as well and commerce as well\nI've I've been very fortunate in that my\nparty and my prime minister have given\nme opportunities to serve in each one of\nthese respons\nthis has been a broad ranging interview\nfor your responses and for your time and\nfor your fiscal discipline in an\nelection cycle uh which is as rare as\nrare can be and that's something that's\nnow being looked at internationally\nFinance Minister thank you so much for\nspeaking to India today in business\nthank you appreciate it let's see if\nyou're back in July you've almost\nindicated that I'll be back in July this\ngovernment will be back who will be\nwhere I cannot that's not my it's much\nbeyond my\npay great thank you so much appreciate\nthank\nyou hello and welcome the most obvious\nimpulse of any Finance Minister heading\ninto an election cycle is to roll out\nthe populist red carpet and yet Finance\nMinister nirmala sitaraman chose fiscal\nPrudence does this reflect a sense of\nconfidence about the Modi government\ncoming back to power a third time is she\nsending a market to a signal to the\ninternational bond markets and what's\nthe economic Outlook from the finance\nMinister's perspective from here on to\ntalk about all of this we're joined at\nthe North block at the finance\nMinister's office by six-time budget\npresenter Nala sitaraman Finance\nMinister welcome and thank you for your\ntime this Finance Minister by my\ncolleague business the television's\nmanaging editor sidat zarabi ma'am I\nwant to start by getting you to talk\nabout the comparison between this\ninterim budget and the last couple of\ninterm budgets which happened just\nbefore the announcement of Elections\nthere was always a lot of populism you\nchose to stay away from that are you\ndeliberately sending out a message that\nI'll be back in July and I'll do what I\nneed to at that time I don't need to do\nanything right\nnow well the message about us coming\nback is the way in which you all\nreporting about things how the\ngovernment has performed how in the last\n10 years those promises which were given\nwere\nfulfilled\nand on the ground actually people are\nactually speaking about about the work\nof this government and not a whisper of\ncorruption so that's the message which\npeople are themselves giving Which you\nthe media are carrying but I've taken\nthe interim budget as an interim\nbudget and asking for a w on account\njust to keep the business going of the\ngovernment is what it is meant for I've\ndone only that when you do a temperature\ncheck of the Indian economy what is it\nthat gives you the greatest reason for\noptimism and what is it that's giving\nyou nightmare or the most concern at\nthis\nmoment\num the optimism bit is because the power\nof the word of\nmouth people who have benefited from\ngovernment's\npromises are speaking about it\nthemselves and they are cross the board\nthey don't belong to any one section one\nregion one state one language one\nreligion they are all over and that\ngives trust in people's mind people\ntrust you will probably trust your\nfriends your neighbors your peers your\ncolleagues rather than trusting a\npolitical leader by Nature India is like\nthat and therefore when people say yes\nI've also got a house here's the paper\nI've got the gas connection what has\ncome to my uh\ntap and my sons are or daughters are\ngetting skills they are getting\nrecruited they going into\nyou know Armed Forces Med colleges seic\nschools so that power of that word of\nmouth among beneficiaries or potential\nbeneficiaries is the one which makes me\nfeel that people realize this is a\ngovernment promise which promises and\ndelivers and the prime minister is\nabsolutely seized of everything that is\nhappening in the ground that is one\nconfidence the other\nconfidence try as they may the\nopposition in the their ruled States as\nwell have not matched this kind of\nperformance and top it all with no one\ngetting any personal pecary\nbenefit not one scandal in 10\nyears the image of India fragile five\npolicy paralysis corruption at every\nlevel it's changed in 10\nyears you think people of India don't\nrecognize that so that's the confidence\nand conerns you yeah Challenge and worry\nmore external Wars abroad you know\nuncertainty in the red sea fish Marine\nLines getting\naffected Transportation Supply Chain\ndisruptions those I think in the last 3\n4 years if you can say with sense of\nconfidence uncertainty has become the\nrule of the game we have to live with it\nwe have to factor in for\nsince you speak about living with\nuncertainty and factoring it in 10 years\nof modomics and you said no scandals why\nthe need for a white paper uh on the\nstate of the economy that the Modi\ngovernment inherited why\nnow prime minister himself has spoken\nabout in 2015 or 16 he said then that\nthere were a lot of people suggesting to\nhim that he'd come out with a white\npaper and he chose not to do it then and\nand he explained the reasons as was\navailable to him at that time he said no\nlook I'll put my nation first I don't\nwant to come up with a white paper which\nis going to reveal all that was left for\nus to inherit and that would only affect\nthe investors's confidence it can affect\nthe trust that the government the people\nof India have in India's own\ninstitutions so it's not the best thing\nfor me to do now so I won't do it\nnow but after 10 full\nyears and after 10 full years of us very\nclearly delivering on our\npromises taking Indian economy closer to\nbeing the third largest economy\nrealizing it probably within a year or\ntwo after we come back let us\nsay we are now in a safe position to say\nto the people of India this is exactly\nwhat we inherited this is what it took\nfor us to correct it\nand in 10 years if this is the level of\neffort we've put not just to restore it\nbut to take it to that\nheight it is this kind of a leadership\nand decision making which we've given\nyou in the last 10 years now that you\noted us so right time to bring it in I\nwould think ma' there's a lot of\nconversation about what's uh going right\nI want to use this opportunity to talk\nabout a couple of areas of concern one\nis on Rural consumption I was reading\nthe earning reports of several of these\nfmcg companies which seem to suggest\ndepending on which company you look at\nat least a 20 to 30% decline in rural\nconsumption a lot of left leaning\neconomists use this to suggest that\nthere is a high level of rural distress\nas Finance Minister how do you look at\nthis concern that uh in the rural sector\nwhen it comes to consumption a lot of\ncompanies are actually seeing distress\nhow much of a concern is that for you\nand how are you hoping to address this\nI wouldn't just put them aside I\nwouldn't say no I'm not worried about it\nand I wouldn't say that their studies\nare worth nothing no not at all I would\ncertainly give it my best of\nattention but I'm not sure it is that 20\n30% that you're talking about fmcb\ncompanies do have a metrics which we\nneed to take seriously because it\nindicates quick buying of durable Goods\nbut equally it is not correct to say\nthat\nrural distress is continuing because I\nthink there's a lot of shift in the way\nin which rural economy is now going\nthrough there's a lot of shift because\nmoney is going in in the name of you\nknow one or the other scheme to every\nfamily in the rural area I would dare\nsay this that there is no family left\nwithout without getting at least one or\nthe other scheme of the government so\nthose who deserve it rural economy is\nalso looking at a changing Paradigm in\nagriculture a lot of uh you know\ncommercial crops are coming in the\nlinkages through the E National\nagriculture Market even today there are\nmedia reports about how between\ndifferent markets in different regions\nbetter rate is actualized\nso farmers are now seeing potential for\nthem to move to different crops the\nemphasis given to the Shri and the\nmillets the emphasis given to\nHorticulture is finding newer markets\nwithin their locality the urban centers\nclose by are benefiting by the\nHorticulture reaching them locally and\nin reasonable price so really it's no\nlonger wheat and rice economy it is a\nlot more of horticulture Fisheries is\nlivestock is gaining a lot of attention\nalso supported by the policy of the\ngovernment SGS which are now into value\naddition and food and also with\nmechanization of\nAgriculture which is bringing the\nmonotony down not throwing people\nout themselves are becoming centers for\nbusiness agriculture let's say a\nfarmer's son or daughter sets up a\nbusiness for Lending Leasing and hiring\nout equipments companies are coming in\nInto The Villages saying we not all of\nthem want tractors but holes trying to\ndeweed every such small agricultural\nequipment is now Finding Traction for\nwhich their their sons and daughters\nthemselves are setting up businesses so\nthere's a lot happening in rural area\nFinance Minister you uh gave a very\ninteresting uh definition of secularism\nand you linked it to saturation of the\navailability of all government schemes\nexpand on that is that now uh the new\ndefinition that the Modi government is\npushing out for secularism because it's\na word that has drawn a lot of debate in\nthe past that's right and uh not just in\n24 elections even in 2019 by which time\nuila had reached good\nDimensions you had people belonging to\ndifferent communities particularly when\nyou talk of glass gas cylinders only\nwomen come forward to talk about it men\nthink it doesn't matter to them because\nultimately the food has reach the table\nhow does it matter whether it is being\ncooked in gas or anything else so men\ntend to talk less about it women come\nout to say yes I'm benefiting with the\ngas\ncylinder people who came out to say that\nuula has helped me to bring a clean air\nin my kitchen and I'm more efficient in\ngetting my food done belong to all\ncommunities even at that time it was\nobserved by media observed by political\nObservers\nthat Wala scheme's implementation has\nproven that every eligible person gets\nit not just the first charge going to\none particular section as it was\nnarrated once earlier by a prime\nminister so that litmus test of te\nsecularism actually in\naction has been felt even in 2019 now\nit's felt even more so if secularism has\nto be practiced you don't need to Pander\nto religious beliefs if you're able to\nacross the board give everybody\neverything you are indifferent to the\nperson's Faith or religion but making\nsure he or she is as good as the other\nnext\ndoor that's action secularism in action\nma'am let's spend a moment on household\nsavings which have been one of the\npillars of the Indian economy in Years\nGone by and now household savings are\nsaid to be at a 5 little low uh at 5.1%\nhow how are you looking at the aspect of\nIndian households seeming to save much\nlesser than they have in past decades\nand is that something that you're okay\nwith is that something that concern\nnecessary conclusion you can arrive\nat households saving lesser than before\nno because as much as you talk about\nsmall savings and quote numbers on it\nthe only option that small saving people\nin middle classes had for saving their\nmoney and with some confidence was to\nput it in let's say post office savings\naccount which continues which is good\nenough which can continue any\nlonger but you're also noticing since\n2020 that because of Greater\ntransparency and greater availability of\ninformation people are able to see which\nare those performing companies they're\nnot even going through the route of\nmutual funds to understand understand\nhow stock market performs small saving\nin the name of retail funding is coming\ninto the stock markets and coming\nthrough demat accounts which are unique\nso I'm not talking about the same person\ndoing five types of Investments new\ndemat accounts unique demat accounts\ntell you probably many things which went\nto post offices came are coming now into\nthe market so people are finding newer\nrevenues to save and probably better\nreturns are accured in those routs since\nwe speaking about the markets uh the\nstock market regulator recently put out\na word of caution with regard to uh you\nknow a lot of the trades that are\nhappening are happening in trading in\nthe derivative segment in F\nAndo do you share that note of concern\nwith regard to the nature of how people\nare trading in the markets that was uh\nmuch higher than what it is now I would\nthink my concern that is much higher\nearlier than it is now because there's a\nlot of awareness being built by\nRegulators to say that uh derivatives\nand dealing in fno O as you said can\nhave involve high risk and many people\nburnt their fingers uh by starting to\noperate there young people who were the\nfirst time entrance also burnt their\nfingers so there was a lot of discussion\nabout it in one of our FS DC meetings uh\nRegulators are now building a lot of\nawareness and uh I would think that\ncaution has come into play now Finance\nMinister how are you you've been chiding\nIndia Inc to go out and invest to find\nthe strength of Hanuman and to invest in\nthe India story and for various reasons\nthe kind of secular investment cycle\nthat you were hoping for hasn't really\nkickstarted you can see some green\nshoots in some sectors but it's not an\noverall investment cycle uh how are you\nviewing because I I we were together\ntogether at the rashtrapati bavan and\nyou were telling a member of India Inc\nto go out and invest even further so how\nare you looking at India Inc in several\nsectors still being in wait and watch\nmode assessing but not committing fully\nto invest at this moment is that now\nbeginning to get a little frustrating\nfor you how are you looking at\ninvestment appetite and actual\nInvestments apart from just the talk but\nuh I would equally say that in those\nSunrise sectors which for which we've\nannounced PL schemes and so\non you find private investment coming in\nand coming in in significant numbers so\nI really cannot say now as I said\nearlier that hey you are anuma Hanuman\nyou start flying it is happening now and\nI would think they are very clear in\ntheir heads that their Investments now\nwill probably go through the newer\nsectors and they may want to build\ncapacities add capacities to the\nexisting areas of activity but many many\nof them are now looking at prospects in\nthe newer areas so it is happening but\nhappening much more in the newer Sunrise\nsector Finance Minister U two key\ninstruments of the government which have\nfocused on getting new manufacturing and\nprivate investment the point that was\njust made one of those schemes of 2019\nthe end date is 31st March 2024 the\nconcessional 15% rate for new\nmanufacturing uh companies along with\nthat you've given a host of P schemes\ntwo parts to the question one do you see\nthe need for continuing with that lower\n15% rate eventually perhaps in the full\nbudget and second uh does bi scheme need\nto expand or at some point of time the\ngovernment will say we supported you as\nmuch as we could now go on and do it on\nyour\nown uh the answer to your second\nquestion is not uh we've done it for a\nfew years so stop it now it's more to\nensure that India gets the lead in those\nsectors in the sunrise areas so I\nwouldn't time it by saying I've done it\nfor 2 years shut shop now that that will\nnot be my Approach my Approach would be\nis it really getting rooted in India is\nit sustainable and are these industries\nreally you know taking off so those will\nbe my measure before I take a call on\nthat so I wouldn't rush to say I've done\nit for 2 years the other is about uh\nthe reduced tax\nrates as I said for many other things\nthis interim budget was not the time for\nme to take a call on that so I've not\ntaken a one of the critics we've heard\nfrom the opposition finance minister is\nthat when it comes to social sectors the\npercentage of government outlays on\neducation on health has come down as a\npercentage of our GDP in the years that\nthis government has been on power they\nlevel the acquisition that while you're\nvery focused on public infrastructure uh\nuh that the amount of money that should\nbe set aside for education and for\nhealthcare isn't adequate and even the\noutlays that are being made are not\nbeing fully spent we're actually\nspending lesser than we provisioned for\nhow do you look at this on the outlay\nnot getting spent I may not be the best\nperson to answer I'll be concerned as to\nwhy the outl are not getting spent but\nit will be the Departments and in\nparticularly health and education States\nalso have a role it is a concurrent uh\nlist of items that we're talking about\nwhen we talk about education and health\nso it will depend on how much absorption\nHapp happens in the states how much the\ndepartment is able to push and so on so\nthose factors are totally out of my\nrealm but I can understand where they\nare and probably a longer discussion can\nhappen only on those two uh issues um\nit's also not right to measure\nexpenditure on education and health as\nbeing adequate or not adequate it can\nnever be adequate it I'll concede that\nany amount that I put for Education will\nstill think I mean you'll think I'll\nthink anybody will feel more can be\nadded and yes more can be added there\ncannot be a second thought on that but\nthe fact remains as I said also for one\nquestion earlier somewhere else about\ncapital expenditure this time being not\n30% in increase only 11%\nincrease there's after all a element\nwhich is called absorption\ncapacity you can put ton loads of money\nsomewhere and the in the capex our\ncondition was you use it within 12\nmonths I'll give you next year but use\nwhat I've given you now fully this year\nthe absorption capacity element makes\nmany of them who genuinely want to spend\nit after a point not able to throttle it\ndown within 12 months they would need 13\n14 15th month also but I'm sorry within\n12 month it hasn't happened fully\nso is the case with education and health\nyou may want to put any number into the\noutlet but eventually unless there's a\nproperly fitted Hospital you're not\ngoing to be able to give additional\ntraining to the staff and spend money on\nthat unless you have more medical seats\navailable you're not going to have\nenough doctors coming into the hospitals\nunless again it is spread all over the\ncountry that's why at one point in time\nI remember dur my atbar announcements we\nsaid no longer are we looking at\nDistrict level hospital now it has to go\nto the Block Level so there are levels\nand levels to which we need to now pad\nwith more efforts and resources so it's\nnot going to happen within one year\nsuppose I say I'm giving more now this\nyear of the\nGDP are they in a position to absorb the\nfirst layer is being set second third\nand so on I can't top at the fifth level\nwhen these are not been done Finance\nMinister since we are speaking about\nallocations um explain the philosophy on\nthe defense allocation you've been\ndefense minister you've been Commerce\nMinister and defense still about 6 lakh\nCR the highest allocation but some\npeople say it's still 4.72% year on-year\ngrowth uh earlier than that in the\nprevious Financial year there was a\nsubstantial increase what's the\nphilosophy behind the defense budget\nallocation so first of all defense and\ntheir procurement you know it coming\nfrom a defense background\nuh your friend Rahul will know it we\nshared that background yes the\nlong-term perspective planning that the\ndefense has is really long time and they\ngo on fitting every year towards\nachieving that long-term\ngoal and for each year it's not a\nproportionate allocation towards that\nlongterm sometime it's more sometimes\nit's less sometimes it's just about all\nright and so on so it is the end goal\nthat your long-term perspective plan\nwhich has to be achieved and in the\nprocess allocations keep going up and\ndown in order that we get a complete\npicture of how money is got to be\nallocated for defense is where the\ndivision happens pensions and salaries\nthe revenue is one account we don't incl\nstill about 52% of the we don't we don't\ninclude that it may be 52% of the Total\nDefense budget no that's that's a\ncommitted one and we since believe it\nshould be where it is got to be and\nafter that is when you're looking at\nreplenishing the\nexisting lifespan of a particular Vector\nlife lifespan of a particular long-term\nasset and then looking at just the\ncomponents and so and then within that\nyou're looking at how much is Army how\nmuch is Navy how much is Air Force how\nmuch is Coast Guard so it is not asive\nwe blindly give one chunk of amount and\nsay sorry that's the end of the story\nyou can do now what what we placed\nemphasis in this vote on account is to\nmake Innovation driven procurement and\nManufacturing within India for at manbar\ndefense so you're driving money towards\ngreater Innovation within the country\nthat you're able to produce those\nequipments which are critical for you\nwithin India for that I made us separate\nallocation so it is now a lot more\ncalibrated to the needs of each one of\nthem\nit's not blanket give money do what you\nwant one of the big developments in the\ninternational money markets this year\nwill be when JP Morgan includes Indian\ngovernment bonds in the uh Government\nBond index for emerging markets from\nJune uh we've seen that you've reduced\nthe fiscal deficit from the projected\n5.9 to 5.8 now hoping to bring this down\nto\n5.1 how much how important is it for you\nto send a message to International\nrating agencies to improve India's\ncredit rate trting at this moment and\nhow are you looking at this inclusion\nand all the billions of dollars that\nflow into India after this see there are\ntwo different things going into JP\nMorgan's listing is one thing you are\ngoing to get money which is going to be\nless costly and it'll be almost a\ndefault setup that it'll keep coming\nonce it is in the list and so\non that's one side yes it'll enable that\nprocess from June let us say but the\nother is about the credit rating\nagencies am I bringing down the fiscal\ndeficit from 5.9 where it was expected\nto be to 5.8 because I want a better\nperspective shared with the F no it can\nbe so it can be a collateral but I'm\nmore aiming at getting India's Fisk a\nlot more primed up a lot more toned up\nso that it doesn't carry too much of\nflab that you're not able to at any\npoint in time take that kind of a you\nknow decision making or give commitments\nto better perform so discipline in\nfiscal management is something which\nPrime Minister Modi takes very seriously\neven as a chief minister he's had a\nrecord showing how he managed economy\nfinances within Gujarat some of the\nstates aren't following this kind of an\napproach How concerned are you by the\nkind of public indied we're seeing in\nsome of the opposition it is concerning\nand we talk to them we try to sort of uh\nhelp them out to rearrange their uh uh\nfiscal But ultimately it is the state's\nresponsibility we can only be the good\nCouncil we can't do anything more beyond\nthat but of course ultimately under\nConstitution's article 293 we are going\nto have to take the final call and\nresponsibility on that but that is a\nvery delicate play because we can't\nencroach into the state's decision\nmaking Finance Minister soon after the\nbudget Moody came out and taking this\npoint forward uh about our uh the rating\nOutlook and it said India's debt to GDP\nStill Remains High despite the fact that\nyou projected a decline 58.1% to 57.2%\nin\nfi25 are rating agencies missing the\npoint about the kind of fiscal\ntransformation that uh the Modi\ngovernment has been trying for the last\n10\nyears it's good that you're saying it\nand I've not said it but that's the\ntruth\nlook at the borrowing debt to GDP number\nfor developed\neconomies they are well beyond 200s and\n300s well over 100 any\ncase their credit rating doesn't get\naffected by the debt to\nGDP so when mine is well with below 100\nat 80 let us say but if it matters to\nthe rating agencies that my debt to GDP\nis not above 100 I have no answers to\ngive it is not above\n100 okay ma'am let's pick for a moment\nabout disinvestment you know you've got\nsome public sector unit uh companies\nwhich are at different stages of\ndisinvestment there is no ambitious\nTarget for disinvestment there seems to\nbe a change in thinking so if you can\nexplain that and if and when you do come\nback to Power uh how important is\nstrategic disinvestment as one of the\nmissions for the Modi government for you\npersonally as Finance Minister how\ncommitted are we still to trying to get\ngovernment out of companies which the\ngovernment really got not to be\nrunning I'll start with the fact that\nI've stated it as a matter of\npolicy went through the parliament got\napproved and came out 2122 budget that\nwe do believe that all sectors should be\nopen for private participation no sector\nshould be reserved for public sector\nonly\nand even if public sector is present in\nthose core strategically important\nsectors they will be minimal presence I\nbelieve in it Prime Minister Modi\nbelieves in it it is the policy approved\nby the parliament of India now therefore\nI will have to consolidate in those\nsectors public sector presence or I will\nwhere I can't amalgamate or bring\ntogether or scale up I will have to get\nout of some of them for which the\napproval is obtained I will have to do\nit but equally before I do it during the\ntime I'm waiting to do it I will have to\npay attention to the valuation of that\nconf I can't allow it to languish and I\ncan't allow it to continue to languish\ntill before I throw them out or till\nbefore I get out of them and when I want\nto get out of them if I don't allow them\nto flourish in the meanwhile the\nvaluation that I obtained from the\nmarket is going to be trivial if\nanything at all so we have for one I\nwant to be sure to tell the people of\nIndia even if I've taken a call to\ndisinvest a complete a company\ncompletely I'm attending to keep it in\nits prime condition now and that is why\nyou find the public sector companies in\nthe stock market now performing much\nbetter and giving better dividends to\nall the shareholders we can be some of\nit and others are also taking the\ndividend from it the other way of also\nlooking at if disinvestment is happening\nis when we have come down in the level\nof holding that I have further letting\nit into the market so that retail uh\ninvestors would come in so the level to\nwhich I hold my shares in a public\npublic sector company also is something\nwhich you have to observe because I'm\nslowly coming down in terms of the level\nto which I'm holding shares in these my\nquestion m' was about as far as a core\ntenant of belief is concerned how\nimportant is strategic disinvestment for\nyou personally and for this government\nat this moment the manner in because we\nsaw Air India happen quite seamlessly\nand you were able to get it out but we\nare we aren't really seeing the same\nsense of pace and urgency when it comes\nto some of the other disinvestment\nprojects currently in the pipeline and\nI'm kind of wondering when you see glad\nto hear this from you Rahul before air\nI was pillared when is it happening when\nis it happening every time I met with a\njournalist friend this would be the\nquestion and at that time it looked as\nif I'm sitting over it over a\ncentury I'm glad to hear that now no as\nI said it will happen our commitments\nwill be fulfilled and the core belief\nthat you keep asking me about that is\nwhy I went back to tell you that it is\nthis government which went to the\nparliament to say disinvestment is what\nwe believe in because other than the\ncore sectors there's no way in which we\nneed to be present as government and in\nthe core sectors it is because of\nstrategic interest Telecom unless I'm\nthere I won't be able to cover my first\nVillages which are now called vibrant\nVillages private sector wouldn't go\nthere but how would I give give them\nconnectivity I need to be there Railways\nI need to be there like that our belief\nis to have minimal presence uh FM just\none quick follow up on that is the\nmarket and other analysts missing the\npoint that the dividends that come to\nyou from Central public sector under\ntakings or for the matter RBI which has\nhelped contain the fiscal deficit in\nthis budget's calculation as well that\nis also in some ways revenue from the\nassets that have been built by the the\nmarket know it it is you journalists who\nwant to go asking me this question okay\nenjoy it I I'll come to another point\nand this is to do with the north south\nnarrative that uh keeps happening two\nquestions there and just to add uh data\nhere the tax Devolution in fi 24 ma'am\nthat you announced and we have seen that\nRose 16% Central transfers are equally\nhigh at\n15% yet there is this north south\nnarrative and some voices from the south\nseem to suggest that the south is\ngetting a raw deal it contributes more\nto tax Collections and the north takes\nit away\nhow would you respond to that it's\nentirely politically M\nmotivated not backed by by facts or data\nand above all very\ndivisionary and encourages sist elements\nit is being done deliberately is my\nallegation I charge them with that\nthey're doing it\ndeliberately if that is the case that we\nwant to talk about look at the\nInvestments that are going to the South\nnot private government\nwhy does the government of India invest\nthen it is because country as a whole\nwill have to leverage the strengths that\nexist in the\ncountry from one area one strength\nminerals material all of them come do we\nthen allow that area to say without me\ngiving you coal without me giving you I\nknow nothing will move so give me the\nentire earning is that the way we look\nat\nthen if that is the way we have to look\nat regions which give higher\nRevenue within a developed state which\nsays I contribute so much Maharashtra\ncontributes a lot more can it say that\ngive me that much one second even within\nKarnataka where the honorable deputy\nchief Minister's brother has said look\nwe are not getting as much as we're\ngiving so it might mean that we'll have\nto form a separate sou country out of\nSouth India I'd like to ask him\nbangaluru contributes to karnataka's\nincome much disproportionately higher\nnow if all citizens of bangaluru say\nlook we want to be a separate country\nman be damned with your kalana Kara be\ndamned with your chitra what will the\ngovernment say there which is now in\npower which is Congress government the\nsame can be for\nMumbai in Maharashtra Mumbai can say\nsorry it's all my money Mumbai becomes a\nseparate country you go witha be your\nown Marat be your own are we okay with\nthat kind of language are we okay with\nthat kind of a thought somewhere in in\nthe back of our\nminds it's utterly\nirresponsible and above all I think it's\ndone with a purpose to bring in that\nelement of you know doubt in the minds\nof people who live in these regions to\nsay oh probably the government is\ncheating us it's not giving us us s you\nare you a elected responsible leader\nsitting in the Lo SAA and there are few\nothers like\nthat believing in the constitution of\nIndia are you speaking\nresponsibly is this the narrative you\nwant to put forth in the\npublic and is it true narrative if it is\ntrue I can then say yeah you're speaking\nthe truth we'll have to look into\nit is this the truth\nwhere does it lead us\nto utterly irresponsible but I think\nthis is the trend with which the\ncongress party is growing in the last 10\nto 20 years we are seeing repetition of\nthe tu tu sympathies within the Congress\nthey went and stood in J with that gang\nwhich wanted to break\nIndia they are now speaking this\nlanguage from the south they supporting\nparties which speak sist language the\nDMK for instance they support them in\nTamil Nadu they speak that\nlanguage so what is this are we here by\nthe\nConstitution or are we different\nelements of break\nIndia ma'am there's been some\nconversation about senior ministers in\nthe Modi cabinet fighting a Lo SAA\nelection while of course that's\nsomething the party will decide would\nyou like to put your hand up and say\ngive me a seat somewhere in Tamil NAD or\nwherever it is that you prefer which\nstate would you prefer to fight from\nprobably Tamil NAD in my understanding\nand would you like to do it would you\nrelish the prospect of getting out of\nNorth block fighting a loab election you\nknow party like BJP it's not the person\nwho relases to do a BC it is the party\nwhich says okay now you do this and you\nmay also want to relish it and we follow\nit but would you relish that challenge\nmoving from what the party says\nright okay now maam you know there was\nan interview that I did with Professor\nauram Rajan at Davos and I've been\nwanting to ask you this question since\nhe\nlarger point was that the government the\nModi government at this moment makes it\nseem as if we're on a 7% growth path and\nthat this is relative to what's\nhappening in the world very good he says\ngiven our stage of economic Evolution we\nshould really be aiming for 9 10% he\nided me to ask government when I got a\nchance uh that you know this is actually\nour current growth prospects and\nforecast are 2 or 3% lesser than what\nyou said while you were in opposition\nand his charge is that just because we\ncan't find the ways of growing at 99 to\n10% the government is now making it seem\nas if 7% is the best that can be done\nlook at China at a similar stage of its\nEvolution cycle look at the Spirit which\nthey were growing if India does intend\nto become a vixit country we need to be\ngrowing at 9 10% how would you respond\nto raguram\nrajin I would want to ask you should I\nrespond to him as raguram Rajan The\nEconomist or raguram Rajan the\npolitician answer will depend on\nit no I want to say this first that's an\nanswer that I'm giving you\nbecause raguram Rajan also had told us\nthat we shouldn't invest anymore in\nmanufacturing concentrate on\nservices but when he wants to talk on\nChina he would compare China has always\ninterested hugely in manufacturing now\nI'm not imitating China we'll have to\nfind ways in which our own strengths can\nbe further\nleveraged so that is one advice\nearlier so I I find it\ndifficult to take raguram rajan's advice\nalso because he was here holding a very\nresponsible position as governor of\nReserve Bank of India the banks went\nthrough\ntorment a\nregulator looked the other way then\nphone calls were going to the banks and\nBanks were yielding to the phone calls\nthe regulator didn't tell them you will\nyield only to the banking norms and not\nthe phone\ncalls so raguram Rajan make up your mind\nwhen you speak to the government and\nnudging the media to go ask the\ngovernment questions say first of all\nlook I'm now wearing my Economist hat\nand sometimes I'm wearing my political\nhat that might be easy for us to address\nFinance Minister many decades ago and I\ngrew up and millions of Indians grew up\nwith the ROI Kara makan slogan and in\nthe last 10 years of modomics Roi\nthrough the uh free food scheme for 800\nmillion plus people and now this budget\nannouncing more expansion as far as\nhousing is concerned also a new scheme\nfor middle class housing hopefully to\naddress people who are on rent the Capa\nis missing or should we look forward for\nanother word instead of Kapa in the RO\nKapa Maan phrase no Kapa is not missing\nis something which the family can choose\nto do if they are\notherwise benefited in terms of the\nbasic\nnecessities so it's not as if you're\ngoing to take care of food but not\nclothe no if that individual and his\nfamily is empowered enough he they'll\ntake a call on how they want to spend\ntheir money instead of I mean like I\nwouldn't want to quote ma but wasn't it\nMa said look no good helping him to fish\ntoday giving him fish in his hand give\nhim the skills to fish he will be able\nto we are aiming at provide the basic\nfacility then give him access to\ndifferent opportunities he wants to do\nhis own business don't stifle him by\nsaying get me a collateral then I'll\nlend you no collateral I'll lend you do\nyour business similarly if they are in\nvillages wanting more technology into\nthe fields we are giving the drones we\nare training them so go do it\nsimultaneously looking at the gender\nparity and so on\nso aim of this government is to empower\nthe person to make his own decision so\nis it Roa Finance because this budget is\nalso announced a longterm scheme for\nfinancing financing has already happened\nit's continuing to happen mudra Swan are\nall financing so that will continue also\nwe will enable people who have\naspirations to become entrepreneurs to\nget assistance from the bank now we're\ncoming towards the end of this interview\nyou've now presented six budgets I want\nyour sense of how you see your Evolution\nas Finance Minister from year one to\nyear six everybody has their own take\nand there's so many pink papers writing\nconstantly about every move you make but\nwhen you look at the mirror and reflect\nhow how do you think you've evolved as\nan economist as a finance minister as an\nindividual as a politic ician over these\nsix years gosh that that's very many I\ncan't answer all of\nthem uh well it's been a challenge and\nalso an opportunity to work in such an\nenvironment and uh it's not just saying\nit I honestly do feel very much from the\nbottom of my heart to have a leader\nunder in the name of Prime Minister Modi\nand work with\nhim I've worked in corporate\nenvironments earlier the level of\nprofessionalism the level\nof\ntask tasking an individual and making\nsure that performance is the only\ncriteria professionalism in work and\nmaking sure that till the last minute if\nguidance and handholding is required it\nis provided being objective being we\nneed to deliver we need to deliver so\nthat sense of working in a team with the\nguidance of the right kind of you know\nassistance and not\npatronage is immensely\nsatisfying r manal with mantal if you\nhad to\npick both were great and and there was\nCommerce as well and commerce as well I\nI've been very fortunate in that my\nparty and my prime minister have given\nme opportunities to serve in each one of\nthese responsibilities this has been a\nbroad ranging interview for your\nresponses and for your time and for your\nfiscal discipline in an election cycle\nuh which is as rare as rare can be and\nthat's something that's now being looked\nat internationally Finance Minister\nthank you so much for speaking to India\ntoday in business thank you appreciate\nit let's see if you're back in July You'\nalmost indicated that I'll be back in\nJuly this government will be back who\nwill be where I cannot that's not my\nit's much beyond my pay R thank you so\nmuch for your time appreciate thank\nyou hello and welome welcome the most\nobvious impulse of any Finance Minister\nheading into an election cycle is to\nroll out the populist red carpet and yet\nFinance Minister nirmala sitaraman chose\nfiscal Prudence does this reflect a\nsense of confidence about the Modi\ngovernment coming back to power a third\ntime is she sending a market to signal\nto the international bond markets and\nwhat's the economic Outlook from the\nfinance Minister's perspective from here\non to talk about all of this we're\njoined at the North block at the finance\nMinister's office by six-time budget\npresenter Nala sitaraman Finance\nMinister welcome and thank you for your\ntime Minister by my colleague business R\ntelevision's managing editor sidat\nzarabi ma'am I want to start by getting\nyou to talk about the comparison between\nthis interim budget and the last couple\nof interm budgets which happened just\nbefore the announcement of Elections\nthere was always a lot of populism you\nchose to stay away from that are you\ndeliberately sending out a message that\nI'll be back in July and I'll do what I\nneed to at that time I don't need to do\nanything right\nnow well the message about us coming\nback is the way in which you all\nreporting about things how the\ngovernment has performed how in the last\n10 years those promises which were given\nwere\nfulfilled\nand on the ground actually people are\nactually speaking about the work of this\ngovernment and not a whisper of\ncorruption so that's the message which\npeople are themselves giving which you\nthe media are carrying but I've taken\nthe interim budget as an interim\nbudget and asking for a wot on a just to\nkeep the business going of the\ngovernment is what it is meant for I've\ndone only that when you do a temperature\ncheck of the Indian economy what is it\nthat gives you the greatest reason for\noptimism and what is it that's giving\nyou nightmare or the most concern at\nthis\nmoment um\nthe optimism bit is because the power of\nthe word of\nmouth people who have benefited from\ngovernment's\npromises are speaking about it\nthemselves and they are cross the board\nthey don't belong to any one section one\nregion one state one language one\nreligion they are all\nover and that gives trust in people's\nmind people trust you will probably\ntrust your friends your neighbor your\npeers your colleagues rather than\ntrusting a political leader by Nature\nIndia is like that and therefore when\npeople say yes I've also got a house\nhere's the paper I've got the gas\nconnection what has come to my uh\ntap and my sons are or daughters are\ngetting skills they are getting\nrecruited they going into you know Arm\nForces M colleges signic schools so that\npower of that word of of mouth among\nbeneficiaries or potential beneficiaries\nis the one which makes me feel that\npeople realize this is a government prom\nwhich promises and delivers and the\nprime minister is absolutely seized of\neverything that is happening in the\nground that is one confidence the other\nconfidence try as they may the\nopposition in the their rulle states as\nwell have not matched this kind of\nperformance and top it all with no one\ngetting any personal Peary\nbenefit not one scandal in 10\nyears the image of India fragile five\npolicy paralysis corruption at every\nlevel has changed in 10\nyears you think people of India don't\nrecognize that so that's the confidence\nChallenge and wor concerns you yeah\nChallenge and worry more external Wars\nabroad you know uncertainty in the red\nsea fish Marine Lines getting\naffected Transportation Supply Chain\ndisruptions those I think in the last 3\n4 years if you can say with sense of\nconfidence uncertainty has become the\nrule of the game we have to live with it\nwe have to factor in for it since you\nspeak about living with uncertainty and\nfactoring it in 10 years of modomics and\nyou said no scandal\nwhy the need for a white paper uh on the\nstate of the economy that the Modi\ngovernment inherited why\nnow prime minister himself has spoken\nabout in 2015 or 16 he said then that\nthere were a lot of people suggesting to\nhim that he'd come out with a white\npaper and he chose not to do it\nthen and he explained the reasons as was\navailable to him at that time he said no\nlook I'll put my nation first I don't\nwant to come up with with a white paper\nwhich is going to reveal all that was\nleft for us to inherit and that would\nonly affect the investors confidence it\ncan affect the trust that the government\nthe people of India have in India's own\ninstitutions so it's not the best thing\nfor me to do now so I won't do it\nnow but after 10 full\nyears and after 10 full years of us very\nclearly delivering on our\npromises taking Indian economy closer to\nbeing the third largest economy\nrealizing it probably within a year or\ntwo after we come back let us\nsay we are now in a safe position to say\nto the people of India this is exactly\nwhat we inherited this is what it took\nfor us to correct it and in 10 years if\nthis is the level of effort we've put\nnot just to restore it but to take it to\nthat height\nit is this kind of a leadership and\ndecision making which we've given you in\nthe last 10 years now that you Ed us so\nright time to bring it in I would think\nm' there's a lot of conversation about\nwhat's uh going right I want to use this\nopportunity to talk about a couple of\nareas of concern one is on Rural\nconsumption I was reading the earnings\nreports of several of these fmcg\ncompanies which seem to suggest\ndepending on which company you look at\nat least a 20 to 30% decline in in rural\nconsumption a lot of left leaning\neconomists use this to suggest that\nthere is a high level of rural distress\nas Finance Minister how do you look at\nthis concern that uh in the rural sector\nwhen it comes to consumption a lot of\ncompanies are actually seeing distress\nhow much of a concern is that for you\nand how are you hoping to address\nthis I wouldn't just put them aside I\nwouldn't say no I'm not worried about it\nand I wouldn't say that their studies\nare worth nothing no not at all I would\ncertainly give it my best of\nattention but I'm not sure it is that 20\n30% that you're talking about fmcb\ncompanies do have um metrics which we\nneed to take seriously because it\nindicates quick buying of durable goods\nbut equally it is not correct to say\nthat\nrural distress is continuing because I\nthink there's a lot of shift in the way\nin which rural economy is now going\nthrough there's a lot of shift because\nmoney is going in in the name of you\nknow one or the other scheme to every\nfamily in the rural area I would dare\nsay this that there is no family left\nwithout getting at least one or the\nother scheme of the government so those\nwho deserve it rural economy is also\nlooking looking at a changing Paradigm\nin\nagriculture a lot of uh you know\ncommercial crops are coming in the\nlinkages through the E National\nagriculture Market even today there are\nmedia reports about how between\ndifferent markets in different regions\nbetter rate is\nactualized so farmers are now seeing\npotential for them to move to different\ncrops the emphasis given to to the Shri\nthe millets the emphasis given to\nHorticulture is finding newer markets\nwithin their locality the urban centers\nclose by are benefiting by the\nHorticulture reaching them locally and\nin reasonable price so really it's no\nlonger wheat and rice economy it is a\nlot more of horticulture Fisheries\nlivestock is gaining a lot of attention\nalso supported by the policy of the\ngovernment SGS which are now into value\nVal addition in food and also with\nmechanization of\nAgriculture which is bringing the\nmonotony down not throwing people\nout themselves are becoming centers for\nbusiness agriculture let's say a farmer\nson or daughter sets up a business for\nLending Leasing and hiring out\nequipments companies are coming in Into\nThe Villages saying we not all of them\nwant tractors but hes trying to DV\nevery such small agricultural equipment\nis now Finding Traction for which their\ntheir sons and daughters themselves are\nsetting up businesses so there's a lot\nhappening in rural areas Finance\nMinister you uh gave a very interesting\nuh definition of secularism and you\nlinked it to saturation of the\navailability of all government schemes\nexpand on that is that now uh the new\ndefinition that the Modi government is\npushing out for secularism because it's\na word that has drawn a lot of debate in\nthe past that's right and uh not just in\n24 elections even in 2019 by which time\nuila had reached good\nDimensions you had people belonging to\ndifferent communities particularly when\nyou talk of glass gas cylinders only\nwomen come forward to talk about it men\nthink it doesn't matter to them because\nultimately the food has reach the table\nhow does it matter whether it is being\ncooked in gas or anything else so men\ntend to talk less about Ed women come\nout to say yes I'm benefiting with the\ngas\ncylinder people who came out to say that\nuula has helped me to bring a clean air\nin my kitchen and I'm more efficient in\ngetting my food done belong to all\ncommunities even at that time it was\nobserved by media observed by political\nobservers that Wala scheme's\nimplementation has proven that every\neligible person person gets it not just\nthe first charge going to one particular\nsection as it was narrated once earlier\nby a prime\nminister so that litmus test of te\nsecularism actually in action has been\nfelt even in 2019 now it's felt even\nmore so if secularism has to be\npracticed you don't need to Pander to\nreligious beliefs if you're able to\nacross the board give everybody\neverything you you are indifferent to\nthe person's Faith or religion but\nmaking sure he or she is as good as the\nother next door that's action secularism\nin action ma'am let's spend a moment on\nhousehold savings which have been one of\nthe pillars of the Indian economy in\nYears Gone by and now household savings\nare set to be at a five decad low uh at\n5.1% how how are you looking at the\naspect of Indian households seeming to\nsave much lesser than they have in past\ndecades and is that something that\nyou're okay with is that something that\nconcerns conclusion you can arrive\nat househ saving lesser than before no\nbecause as much as you talk about small\nsavings and quote numbers on it the only\noption that small saving or people in\nmiddle classes had for saving their\nmoney and with some confidence was to\nput it in like let's say post office\nsavings account which continues which is\ngood enough which can continue any\nlonger but you're also noticing since\n2020 that because of Greater\ntransparency and greater availability of\ninformation people are able to see which\nare those performing companies they're\nnot even going through the rout of\nmutual funds to understand how stock\nmarket performs small saving in the name\nof retail funding is coming into the\nstock markets and coming through demat\naccounts which are unique so I'm not\ntalking about the same person doing five\ntypes of Investments new demat accounts\nunique demat accounts tell you probably\nmany things which went to post offices\ncame are coming now into the market so\npeople are finding newer revenues to\nsave and probably better returns are\naced in those routs since we speaking\nabout the markets uh the stock market\nregul recently put out a word of caution\nwith regard to uh you know a lot of the\ntrades that are happening are happening\nin trading in the derivative segment in\nF\nAndo do you share that note of concern\nwith regard to the nature of how people\nare trading in the markets that was uh\nmuch higher than what it is now I would\nthink my concern that is much higher\nearlier than it is now because there's a\nlot of awareness being built by\nRegulators to say that uh derivatives\nand dealing in fno as you said can have\ninvolve high risk and many people burned\ntheir fingers uh by starting to operate\nthere young people who were the first\ntime entrance also burnt their fingers\nso there was a lot of discussion about\nit in one of our fsdc meetings uh\nRegulators are now building a lot of\nawareness and uh I would think that has\ncome into play now Finance Minister how\nare you you've been chiding India Inc to\ngo out and invest to find the strength\nof Hanuman and to invest in the India\nstory and for various reasons the kind\nof secular investment cycle that you\nwere hoping for hasn't really kick\nstarted you can see some green shoots in\nsome sectors but it's not an overall\ninvestment cycle uh how are you viewing\nbecause I I we were together at the\nrashtrapati bav and you were telling a\nmember of India Inc to go out and invest\neven further how are you looking at\nIndia in in several sectors still being\nin waitand watch mode assessing but not\ncommitting fully to invest at this\nmoment is that now beginning to get a\nlittle frustrating for you how are you\nlooking at investment appetite and\nactual Investments apart from just the\ntalk but uh I would equally say that in\nthose Sunrise sectors which for which\nwe've announced P schemes and so\non you find private investment coming in\nand coming in in significant numbers\nso I really cannot say now as I said\nearlier that hey you are anuma Hanuman\nyou start playing it is happening now\nand I would think they very clear in\ntheir heads that their Investments now\nwill probably go through the newer\nsectors and they may want to build\ncapacities add capacities to the\nexisting areas of activity but many of\nthem are now looking at prospects in the\nnewer areas so it is happening but\nhappening much more in the newer sunrise\nsector Finance Minister U two key\ninstruments of the government which have\nfocused on getting new manufacturing and\nprivate investment the point that was\njust made one of those schemes of 2019\nthe end date is 31st March 2024 the\nconcessional 15% rate for new\nmanufacturing uh companies along with\nthat you've given a host of PL schemes\ntwo parts to the question one do you see\nthe need for continuing with that lower\n15% rate eventually perhaps in the the\nfull budget and second uh does bi scheme\nneed to expand or at some point of time\nthe government will say we supported you\nas much as we could now go on and do it\non your\nown uh the answer to your second\nquestion is not uh we've done it for a\nfew years so stop it now it's more to\nensure that India gets that lead in\nthose sectors in the sunrise areas so I\nwouldn't time it by saying I've done it\nfor 2 years shut shop now that that will\nnot be my Approach my Approach would be\nis it really getting rooted in India is\nit sustainable and are these industries\nreally you know taking off so those will\nbe my measure before I take a call on\nthat so I would't rush to say I've done\nit for 2 years the other is about uh\nthe reduced tax\nrates as I said for many other things\nthis interim budget was not the time for\nme to take a call on that so I'm not\ntaken a lot one of the critics we've\nheard from the opposition finance\nminister is that when it comes to social\nsectors the percentage of government\noutlays on education on health has come\ndown as a percentage of our GDP in the\nyears that this government has been on\npower they level the acquisition that\nwhile you're very focused on public\ninfrastructure uh that the amount of\nmoney that should be set aside for\neducation and for healthare isn't\nadequate and even the outlays that are\nbeing made are not being fully spent\nwe're actually spending lesser than we\nprovision for how do you look at this on\nthe outlays not getting spent I may not\nbe the best person to answer I'll be\nconcerned as to why the hotel are not\ngetting spent but it'll be the\nDepartments and in particularly health\nand education States also have a role it\nis a concurrent list of items that we're\ntalking about when we talk about\neducation and health so it will depend\non how much absorption Happ happens in\nthe states how much the department is\nable to push and so on so those factors\nare totally out of my realm but I can\nunderstand where they are and probably a\nlonger discussion can happen only on\nthose two uh issues um it's also not\nright to measure expenditure on\neducation and health as being adequate\nor not adequate it can never be adequate\nI'll concede that any amount that I put\nfor Education will still think I mean\nyou'll think I'll think anybody will\nfeel more can be added and yes more can\nbe added there cannot be a second\nthought on that but the fact remains as\nI said also for one question earlier\nsomewhere else about capital expenditure\nthis time being not 30% in increase only\n11%\nincrease there's after all a element\nwhich is called absorption capacity you\ncan put ton loads of money somewhere and\nthe in the capex are condition was you\nuse it within 12 months I'll give you\nnext year but use what I've given you\nnow fully this year the absorption\ncapacity element makes many of them who\ngenuinely want to spend it after a point\nnot able to throttle it down within 12\nmonths they would need 13 14 15th month\nalso but I'm sorry within 12 month it\nhasn't happened fully so is the case\nwith education and health you may want\nto put any number into the\noutlay but eventually unless there's a\nproperly fitted Hospital you're not\ngoing to be able to give additional\ntraining to the staff and spend money on\nthat unless you have more medical seats\navailable you're not going to have\nenough doctors coming into the hospitals\nunless again it is spread all over the\ncountry that's why at one point in time\nI remember during my atbar announcements\nwe said no longer are we looking at\nDistrict level hospital now it has to go\nto the Block Level so there are levels\nand levels to which we need to now pad\nwith more efforts and resources so it's\nnot going to happen within one year\nsuppose I say I'm giving more enough\nthis year of the\nGDP are they in a position to absorbed\nthe first layer is being set second\nthird and so on I can't STP at the fifth\nlevel when these have not been done\nFinance Minister since we are speaking\nabout allocations um explain the\nphilosophy on the defense allocation\nyou've been defense minister you've been\nCommerce Minister and defense still\nabout 6 lakh CR the highest allocation\nbut some people say it's still 4.72%\nyear- on-year growth uh earlier than\nthat in the previous Financial year\nthere was a substantial increase what's\nthe philosophy behind the defense budget\nallocation first of all defense and\ntheir procurement you know it coming\nfrom a defense background uh your friend\nRahul will know it we shared that\nbackground yes the long-term\nperspective planning that the defense\nhas is really long time and they go on\nfitting every year towards achieving\nthat long-term\ngoal and for each year it's not a\nproportionate allocation towards that\nlong term sometime it's more sometimes\nit's less sometimes it's just about all\nright and so on so it is the end goal\nthat your long-term perspective plan\nwhich has to be achieved and in the\nprocess the allocations keep going up up\nand down in order that we get a complete\npicture of how money is got to be\nallocated for defense is where the\ndivision happens pensions and salaries\nthe revenue is one account we don't\nstill about 52% of the we don't we don't\ninclude that it may be 52% of the Total\nDefense budget no that's that's a\ncommitted one and we sincerely believe\nit should be where it is got to be and\nafter that is when you're looking at\nreplenishing the existing\nlifespan of a particular Vector life\nlifespan of a particular long-term asset\nand then looking at just the components\nand so and then within that you're\nlooking at how much is Army how much is\nNavy how much is Air Force how much is\nCoast Guard so it is not as if we\nblindly give one chunk of amount and say\nsorry that's the end of the story you\ncan do now what we placed emphasis in\nthis vot on account is to make\nInnovation driven procurement and\nManufacturing within India for atbar\ndefense so you're driving money towards\ngreater Innovation within the country\nthat you're able to produce those\nequipments which are critical for you\nwithin India for that I made a separate\nallocation so it is now a lot more\ncalibrated to the needs of each one of\nthem it's not blanket give money do what\nyou want one of the big developments in\nthe international money markets this\nyear will when JP Morgan includes Indian\ngovernment bonds in the uh Government\nBond index for emerging markets from\nJune uh we've seen that you've reduced\nthe fiscal deficit from the projected\n5.9 to 5.8 now hoping to bring this down\nto\n5.1 how much how important is it for you\nto send a message to International\nrating agencies to improve India's\ncredit rating at this moment and how are\nyou looking at this inclusion and all\nthe billions of dollars that flow into\nIndia after this see there are two\ndifferent different things going into JP\nMorgan's listing is one thing you are\ngoing to get money which is going to be\nless\ncostly and it'll be almost a default\nsetup that it'll keep coming once it is\nin the list and so\non that's one side yes it'll enable that\nprocess from June let us say but the\nother is about the credit rating\nagencies am I bringing down the fiscal\ndeficit from 5.9 where it was expected\nto be to 5.8 because I want a better\nperspective shared with the F no it can\nbe so it can be a collateral but I'm\nmore aiming at getting India's Fisk a\nlot more primed up a lot more toned up\nso that it doesn't carry too much of\nflab that you're not able to at any\npoint in take that kind of a you know\ndecision making or give commitments to\nbetter perform so discipline in fiscal\nmanagement is something which Prime\nMinister Modi takes very seriously even\nas a chief minister he's had a record\nshowing how he managed economy finances\nwithin Gujarat but some of the states\naren't following this kind of an\napproach How concerned are you by the\nkind of public indicted we're seeing in\nsome of the opposition it is concerning\nand we talk to them we try to sort of uh\nhelp them out to rearrange their uh uh\nfiscal But ultimately it is the state\nresponsibility we can only be the good\nCouncil we can't do anything more beyond\nthat but of course ultimately under\nConstitution's article 293 we are going\nto have to take the final call and\nresponsibility on that but that is a\nvery delicate play because we can't\nencroach into the states decision making\nFinance Minister soon after the budget\nMoody's came out and taking this point\nforward uh about our uh the rating\nOutlook and it said India's debt to GDP\nStill Remains High despite the fact that\nyou projected decline 58.1% to 57.2% in\nfi25 are rating agencies missing the\npoint about the kind of fiscal\ntransformation that uh the Modi\ngovernment has been trying for the last\n10\nyears it's good that you're saying it\nand I've not said it but that's the\ntruth look at the borrowing debt to GDP\nnumber for developed\neconomies the they are well beyond 200s\nand\n300s well over 100 any\ncase their credit rating doesn't get\naffected by the debt to\nGDP so when mine is well below 100 at 80\nlet us say but if it matters to the",

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZPAK9iTpYQ",
    "transcript": "Aston Martin is gunning for Red Bull\nwith its 2024 F1 car which has revealed\na key change that Mercedes has made\nAston Martin started last year as Red\nBull's closest Challenger and has made\nchanges all over with its 2024 car which\nit hopes will be able to fight for a\nfirst win in this identity the last\nvictory coming as racing point in 2020\nit has adopted the view that redol is\nabsolutely beatable in 2024 with\ntechnical director Dan Fallows declaring\nAston Martin is very pleased with what\nwe've been able to achieve but this is\nthe first step what Mercedes has done\nwill play a significant role in that\nwe've long since known that Mercedes\nwanted to make a big mechanical platform\nchange with its 2024 car after 2 years\nof struggling to crack this era of\ntechnical regulations and the AMR 24\ngives us the first clues of what\nMercedes has done one of the\ndevelopments Aston Martin has\nhighlighted on its new car is a key\nMercedes driven change so it's the\nsuspension where we need to look but not\nat the front there Aston Martin retains\nthe push rod configuration it ran last\nyear with a similar layout although the\nUpper Front Wishbone seems to have some\ndownward shaping towards the wheel and\nthe rearward leg may have a lower\ninboard mounting this is likely to be to\nachieve anti-dive a key part of the\nmechanical platform control Mastered by\nRed Bull keeping the aerodynamics in a\nmore steady state under heavy braking\nthat's a more subtle change on the Aston\nMartin but at the rear it has switched\nfrom pull Rod to push rod and this is\nwhere Mercedes comes\nin Aston Martin uses the latest\nspecification Mercedes gearbox and rear\nsuspension as part of its supp IDE deal\nwith the team therefore the fact Aston\nMartin now has a push rod rear\nconfiguration is significant as it means\nMercedes has it too as Aston technical\ndirector Dan phow says it has been\ninherited push rod rear suspension\nconfiguration provides improved\naerodynamic opportunity the pull rod and\npush rod do much the same thing it's\njust that one pulls on The Rocker to\nactuate it and the other pushes but this\nconfiguration offers some advantages as\nthe push rod is mounted High inboard and\nlow outboard this allows the gearbox\npotentially to be a little narrower at\nthe front and can help ensure cleaner\nair flow at the rear of the car Aston\nMartin says the rear suspension design\nhas been optimized to maximize\nefficiency of air flow around the rear\nwing this is all part of a change in\nsuspension that Mercedes has produced to\nimprove the all important platform\ncontrol of the car last year Mercedes\nstarted the season with a car that was\nan evolution of its 2022 machine this\nwas based on the belief that having got\non top of the bouncing and purposing\nproblems that blighted it the car would\nfundamentally work that proved misplaced\nand major changes were made in the car\ncon cep with a change of development\ndirection that was introduced at Monaco\nin May but this was only a partial shift\nas Mercedes was limited by the\nfundamental architecture of its car as a\nresult we expected the monoco design to\nbe modified for 2024 and we now know the\nrear suspension has been changed to\nswitch to the push rod configuration but\nit's not just about that there's also an\nincrease in the level of antis squat on\nthe rear suspension to help control how\nlow the back of the car gets to the\nground this is indicated by the vertical\nangle between the forward and the rear\nleg of the upper Wishbone and as the\nforward W leg is now mounted lower in\nboard than it was last year the rear leg\nis now significantly higher than it\ncreating a larger angle this is all\nabout improving the platform control and\nshould make it easier to run the car low\nto the ground to generate prodigious\ndownforce without bottoming\nout while some of Aston Martin's own\nideas from 2023 have moved on we can see\nclear inspiration from last year's Red\nBull 2 that's not surprising as Aston\nMartin was one of the first teams to\nmove in Red Bull's Direction in these\nregulations and phow said some\nconvergence is inevitable when a car is\nas successful as the rb19 was starting\nout the front the nose tip has been\ndetached from the main plane this has\nbeen a feature on both Red Bulls in this\nrule set as the tip of the nose no\nlonger intersects the main plane there's\na gap created that improves airf flow\nunder the nose the surface of the nose\ntip is also more rounded allowing the\nair flow to come off the upper surface\nand around the sides with minimal effort\nthis is the central area that the\ndiffuser mainly draws its air flow from\nso anything that can be done at the\nfront of the car will will improve the\nperformance further rearwards the tip\nchange means the main plane and the\nsecond plane are now attached by six\nseparators and the real thing looks\ndifferent to the renders there are two\nconnections either side of the main\nplane below the tip then two more\ntowards the end of the wing the second\nplane and the wing element above it also\nhave several slot Gap separators that\nweren't pictured on the renders but\nthese look fairly standard not like the\naerodynamically shaped ones Mercedes\nonce Tri moving to a favorite area of\nchange across the 2024 cars launched so\nfar the side pod Inlet we can see\nanother step towards the Red Bull\napproach Aston Martin already adopted\nthe extended lower part last year but\nits current interpretation is the\nclosest to the aggressive Red Bull\nletter box shape that we first saw on\nthe rb19 in Hungary last year it results\nin a very different side pod Inlet\nprofile for the AMR 24 and is the best\nresemblance to Red Bull's duck bill as\nour resident ex technical director Gary\nAnderson likes to describe it as further\nalong the side pod we can see more\nchanges on the top surface the Aston\nMartin Gully water slide feature remains\nalthough it looks narrower than before\nwith a slightly wider Ridge to the edge\nof the side pod on the outside of the\nside pod the launch images suggested a\nreturn to the package the team attempted\nto implement on the AMR 23 but on the\nreal thing we can see the whole pod is\nmore shrink wrapped than before after\nwhat looks like an even more aggressive\ninitial undercut the side pod has a\nslightly bulbous Central section that's\ncut shorter than the more elongated\nstyle that Aston Martin ran with for\nmost of last year the bigger gap between\nthe Pod and the floor now looks to have\na smoother surface too again that was a\nfeature of the late 2023 upgrade package\nas were the low small side impact\nprotection system bulge and the Turning\nveins on the floor Edge that crop up\nagain on the 2024 renders although that\nsips bulge looks bigger on the real car\nthat's run at Silverstone it's possible\nthat ason Martin has found a way to\naddress the issues with the upgrade\npackage it trialed late last year and\nhad to abandon elements of however we\ncan't rule out elements of this being a\ndummy before the car runs in testing and\nthe first race another example of this\nis the rear Wing where the basic design\non the render looks nothing like the\nreal thing that's running the Shakedown\nat Silverstone which looks similar to\nwhat Aston ran in the 2023 Abu Dhabi\nfinale while the Shakedown has given us\na bit of a steer we'll be on the lookout\nfor which details are actually the real\ndeal in\nBahrain fellows has emphasized creating\na strong platform for development with\nwhat's been prioritized on the AMR 24\npicking up on a key 2023 weakness phow\nsaid Aston Martin wants to compete in\nthe development race this season and\nthis car is designed to do just that\nAston Martin started last season\nspectacularly with a run of six Podium\nfinishes in the first eight races\ninitially it was Red Bull's biggest\nrival and the team talked about closing\nthe Gap as the season progressed but\nthat ambition was thwarted and Aston\nMartin faded from second in the\nConstructor Championship after Monaco to\nfifth while life was made Harder by\nRivals improving notably mcclaren's\ntransformation from back marker to front\nrunner Aston Martin's Pace relative to\nthe front also took a hit in the second\nhalf of the season the going got tough\nas Alonzo puts it we maybe went in the\nwrong direction a few times and\nunderstood it a bit too late the\nquestion is why as well as the struggles\nof Rivals helping out early on there was\na run of circuits that masked some of\nthe weaknesses of the AMR 23 in the\nopening races its first downturn came in\nBarcelona which exposed the difficulties\nthe team had in setting up the car to\nperform well across a wide range of\ncorner speeds Alonzo finished second\nwith the new floor in Canada but this\nwas a full Dawn as the car lost\nperformance in the medium and fast\ncorners and picked up some instability\nit's likely this partly lay in some of\nthe trickier to control aspects of this\ncurrent generation of car in terms of\nprecisely controlling the aerodynamic\nCenter of pressure shift and the\nbehavior of the mechanical platform\nafter various upgrades and experiments\ntowards the end of the season the team\nwent back to basics with a mix and match\npackage that worked well and proved it\nunderstood how to get the best out of\nwhat it had got phow says that work was\nrelevant for this year's car and the\nteam expects to put upgrades on the car\nwith confidence as a result of last\nyear's\nlessons\none consequence of the AMR 24's\nperformance level is likely to be\nAlonzo's future Aston Martin wants to\nkeep the two-time world champion for\n2025 and 2026 but Alonzo has been more\nequivocal though Alonzo repeatedly\nstated that Aston Martin would be his\nfirst priority he said he would go\nthrough a couple of phases this season\nbefore settling on his future first he\nclaims he needs to decide if he even\nwants to keep racing and if is Alonzo's\nword not ours that's partly a reflection\nof f1's bulging calendar if F1 is\ndemanding more race weekends and more\nmarketing commitments and he feels his\noptions aren't stunning even Alonzo\ncould decide enough is enough working\nout his options will be the second phase\nthat Alonzo referenced right now the\ndriver Market is Shifting massively in\nthe wake of Lewis Hamilton's shock\ndecision to leave Mercedes for Ferrari\nin 2025 that opens the door to Mercedes\nfor Alonzo he says there haven't been\nany discussions but he will know that\ncould be a great opportunity very\npossibly a better one than leading the\nAston Martin project Alonzo says he does\ntrust what's going on at Aston Martin\nbut he also knows that needs to\ntranslate into the right trajectory on\ntrack starting with the improvements he\nwould love to see in testing better\nperformance in highspeed corners and\nbetter straight line speed if the AMR 24\ndoesn't give Alonzo what he needs Alonzo\nis happy to exploit what he calls a\nprivileged position in the dri Market as\none of only three world champions on the\ngrid and the only available one as\nAlonzo claims this will be a question he\ngets asked for the first few months of\nthe year he's clearly in no rush to\ncommit he knows there's a chance that\nason Martin will need him a lot more\nthan he needs Aston\nMartin",

more\ndramatic world championship fight I'm\nedw and joining me to pose the big\nquestions of 2024 and even have a go at\nanswering them are Scott Mitchell Mal\nand Glenn Freeman Scott welome happy New\nYear how are your celebrations yeah\nhappy New Year happy to be here and\nrecording definitely in 2024 at the very\nstart of the New Year how about those\nlottery numbers last night who would\nhave thought that the number 20 would\ncome up four times in the same lottery\ndraw that that's that was astonishing\nexcellent so did you win well I didn't\nbut unfortunately I didn't have that\nadvanced knowledge that it would have\nbeen really really useful to have picked\nall of those numbers on my ticket but\nI'm thought maybe someone else will cash\nin instead it's a it's a very specific\nchoice for your generic uh New Year\ncelebrations Reflections I had a very\ngeneric vague New Year it certainly\nhappened and I'm certainly uh feeling\nthe after effects of it Glenn how about\nyou well I don't know why you two are\ntrying to be so funny and vague I had an\nearly night on the 31st so we could\nrecord this at the crack of dawn on New\nYear's Day absolutely in the middle of\nthe night pretty much from the uh from\nthe release time so yeah just in case\nanyone's wondering it's definitely not\nDecember when we're recording this we\ndefinitely not got ahead and we're\ndefinitely not currently probably asleep\nfor those of you who are listening into\nthis sharp hang on hang on there's\nthere's no way Scott and I are going to\nbe asleep when this comes out no exactly\nyou might be um you know completely free\nto just live your life as you please Ed\nbut unfortunately we've chosen to ruin\nour yeah well probably should be clear\nwe mean by having children yeah I've got\nno child care responsibilities\nfortunately that'll definitely be paying\nme off on uh on New Year's Day and\nthat's why you were on the town last\nnight Ed celebrating New Year well as is\nmy style of course as as is well known\nI'm famous for it so yeah that's why\nwe're possibly getting ahead but I still\nthink our our salutations of happy New\nYear are legitimate to all our listeners\nthanks for joining us for another year\non the race F1 podcast and we are on\nthis podcast going to look ahead to the\n2024 F1 season seems the appropriate\ntime to do it we're going to tackle some\nof the big questions now we won't have\ncomprehensive answers to these questions\nbut we can explain why they're important\nand get our take based on the somewhat\nlimited information we've got so far so\nfirst up question one Scott will Red\nBull's dominance continue I really\nreally really hope that the answer to\nthis is either no or yes but they but\nit'll be really hard fought I i' I can't\nexpress anything other than hope for\nthat at the moment I certainly don't\nhave the\nexpectation that it won't continue\nbecause one of the advantages that Red\nBull had because of the the the size of\nthe the the Performance Edge that it\nthat it had early in 2023 but also the\nvarious problems that all of its Rivals\nhad is that it wasn't Under Pressure to\ndevelop hard in the first part of 2023\nor even through 2023 and then therefore\ntake away precious resource and time\nfrom from its 2024 work which was\nobviously from October 22 to October 23\nmuch more of a pressing issue for Red\nBull in light of the penalty that they\ngot for breaking the budget cap back in\n2021 with the further restrictions on\nwhat they could do with the wind tunnel\nand with the CF D testing allowances\nthat they have so they almost got a\nlittle bit of a free pass from their\nRivals with that with that penalty and\nit just meant that well it's it's would\nbe wrong to say that the rb9 was\nuntouched through 2023 we we we saw\nquite a few a few upgrades but they just\nthere wasn't the emphasis on improving\nthat car and it allowed them to get\nahead effectively on the 2024 car so I\ndon't see why rb20 would be compromised\nin any way I think rb20 will be\nEvolution and a very good Evolution on\non rb19 and\nunfortunately that sets quite an ominous\nBenchmark for rll's Rivals yeah you\nalways have to look for reasons why\nthings might change and as it steady\nstate the trends are that Red Bull can\njust continue on its Serene trajectory\nwith its car concept and get some more\nperformance out of it While others are\nhaving to change their direction there's\nno reason in any of that to expect\nthings to change for Red Bull so perhaps\nGlenn you can try and find either some\nreason we haven't thought of or perhaps\ngive a slightly water down version of\nthe question which is Will Red Bull's\ndominance be at least lessened it should\nbe lessened um I nearly said this year\nbut of course it's now 2024 uh 2023\nshould be an anomaly in that it was Red\nBull adding more layers of perfection to\nthe best um first attempt at these new\nrules that we had in 2022 whilst its two\nbest what should have been its two best\nplace rivals Mercedes and Ferrari were\nstill getting it wrong so you had these\ngreat leaps from Aston Martin and\nMcLaren but they were coming from so far\nback that you couldn't expect any more\nof them so the onus was on the other uh\ntwo members of The Big Three and they\ndropped the ball so as we come on to\nlater you've got to hope that they\nfinally make some progress but I've\nthere's an interesting you talked about\nit being steady state Ed and I think\nthat's really interesting because over\nthis this winter I've I've come to a\nrealization that Max for\nstappen uh three years of winning the\nWorld Championship so far remind me of\nthe start of Michael schumaker's\ndominance with Ferrari so the first year\nis an epic title fight with kind of that\ndriver's defining rival so we had vapen\nversus Hamilton for that read Schumaker\nversus hackin and in 2000 then you had\nuh Max's second title was you you know\nthe Red Bull was the best car and he did\nthe best job and they got it wrapped up\nearly but there was a bit of a challenge\nthat was schumacker in 2001 with kind of\nWilliams and McLaren were snapping at\nFerrari's heels sometimes then you had\n2002 Ferrari and schumacker obliterated\neveryone 2023 for stappen and Red Bull\nobliterated everyone the difference is\nthat steady state phrase because in\n2002 F1 and that really means Bernie Eon\npanicked and he he he forced through he\ngot the faia to make loads of rule\nchanges in conjunction with Max Mosley\nthat they came together Max's attitude\nwas more always kind of if you're doing\nthe best job you deserve to win Bernie's\nattitude was this is a show this is a\nbusiness this is a TV product we've got\nto do something this time Stephano DEA\ncar who's in that role has held his\nnerve he is backing the other teams to\nclose the gap without having to\ninterfere and he's been quite clear\nhasn't he I would say over the last you\ncould probably say 12 months he doesn't\nwant F1 to intervene so we're going to\nsee if that pays off for him he's I he's\ngambling from the point of view of\nf1's priorities are that this is a\nsuccessful business and TV ratings have\ngone down for the last two years so it\nis a Gamble and it's it'll be very\ninteresting to see if it pays off for\nhim I thought you were tearing up a\nprediction of a classic 2003 Star season\nthere but you undercut it with your\ndamned facts about the past bring back\nV10 on I was going to say who's going to\nplay the role of the wins One race but\nsomehow takes the title to the to the\ndeci and how much of an achievement\nwould that be in a 24 Race season it\nwould take some going wouldn't it\nespecially with an old car given that\neverybody's old cars last year were a\nbit rubbish yeah exactly I think one of\nthe things that and this actually this\nleads leads on from that steady state\npoint that that Ed made because one of\nthe things that I felt was a bit\ndisingenuous at the end of last year\nwhen Christian her spoke was um he\ntalked about 2021 and what happened to\nMercedes being no guarantee of the\ndominance continuing because obviously\nMercedes absolutely ran away with it in\n2020 and then Lewis lost the the title\nto the stappen in 2021 and we had a\nabsolute ding-dong fight from race one\nto to the final round that wasn't steady\nstate there's a massive difference\nbetween what happened between 2020 and\n2021 and what's happening between now uh\nbetween 2023 and 2024 and that\ndifference is that there aren't a set of\nregulations basically designed to to\nscrew the dominant team over because\nthat is a that was a massive factor in\n2021 we had that quartet of small but\nsignificant changes which basically\nmoved uh I wouldn't say moved the\nadvantage away from but it hurt cars\nlike and I say cars like basically only\nthe Mercedes and the racing point which\nthen became the Aston Martin and\nmassively favored the high rate cars so\nall of a sudden yes there had been\nprogress at the end of 2020 and Red Bull\nhad ended 2020 in a better position that\nalso hasn't happened now they they\naren't under like they aren't losing\nraces now but they were also then given\nmassive assistance with a significant if\nsmall set of rule changes and that just\nisn't happening this year so it's a it's\na very significant it's a very\nsignificant difference don't don't get\nHoodwinked by any quotes you see saying\noh well we've seen it in the past when\nnothing\nchanges why should anything change so\nyou we really are putting the emphasis\non the rivals having more to find than\nRed Bull tripping up over something or\nsomething holding them back if people\nwould like a glimmer of hope there is\none in so far as it's not necessarily\nthe case that Red Bull has hit upon\neverything that's right and virtuous\nabout these regulations there might be\nsome untapped concept that some other\nteam can hit on I feel like it's quite\nunlikely with how tight the RS are but\nit's always possible because we know and\nwe'll get on to this in a minute other\nteams are changing their Concepts and\napproach so there's a a possibility of\nthat I'd be quite surprised but it's\nalways a relative game isn't it and just\nbecause Red Bull have had the best car\nfor the first two years of this reg\ndoesn't necessarily mean it is the best\npossible car and there's always some way\nto go so that's the that's the hope and\nthat's what the other teams will be\nusing to drive themselves on and on\nwhich note Glenn let's talk about one of\nthose teams this big question is can\nMercedes get its car concept\nright well um I it's got to be better\nthan the last two years um because I\nthink they've come they have they did\ncome to that realization that the the\nthe the route they were going down on\ntheir own was was wrong I remember\nsaying to somebody about this time last\nyear what we need is the Mercedes\narrives in 2023 testing with Big Red\nBull style side pods on it and is's\nRapid in testing and then we'll have a\ngreat season it came out with no side\npods was still rubbish was still\nbouncing leis Hamilton still hated it\nand they were you know they paid the\nprice for that all year my concern\nalthough they should go back in the\nright direction my concern is you are\nasking them to get this version of the\ncar right at the first attempt and I\nfind that unlikely so I think it'll be\nbetter but are we going to see them make\nyou know are they going to produce kind\nof what we saw McLaren do the back half\nof last year maybe where they on certain\ntracks and on its day the Mercedes can\nbe up there snapping at a Red Bull's\nheels I think that's about the best they\ncan hope for James Allison has come back\nbut he's had a limited amount of time\nkind of pulling the strings again and F1\ncar\nperformance is It's Kind it's an oil\ntanker it takes a long time to turn\nthings around you can't just click your\nfingers anymore and go ah we were doing\nit wrong we know what we should have\nbeen doing we fixed it we're back at it\num again McLaren is kind of your hope\nthere but they were coming from such a\nlow base uh whereas\nMercedes that you know they still they\nstill finished second in the\nchampionship uh it was just that they\nnever looked like winning a Race So that\nwas the concern I think they can be in\nthe mix I I don't see I I don't have\nenough faith in that I'm unfortunately\nunder this rule set yet to believe that\nthey're suddenly going to come out with\na a Red Bull beater or a Red Bull\nmatcher they should at least be able to\nbe in the right direction I would expect\nnow people for the first time in this\nrule set well that's the thing people\nsay change exactly well people will say\nhang on a minute we were talking about\nthis going into last year and they had\nthe same concept they didn't get it\nright but there were some differences I\noh this is going to be difficult in\nterms of time streams I've written a\npiece which at the moment I'm speaking\nhas not yet run but almost certainly\nwill have run by the time you hear this\nthat was based on a James Allison\ninterview and he basically said their\nbig mistake was that they thought\nthought that their car even at the end\nof 2022 their car concept with the\nbouncing and purposing problem not\nnecessarily eliminated but dramatically\nmitigated by the rule changes was enough\nand they they ignored a lot of the\nfeedback that drivers were giving them\nbecause they thought the first order\nproblem was all of the bouncing and\npping but there were other problems\nbeyond that and it took this Following\nseason for them to learn that so the\nMonaco change was was a big shift to\nchange what they could within the\nlimitations of the architecture of the\ncar now next year's car will have a a\ndifferent rear suspension different\ngearbox to go with that different monoco\nshape they'll probably move around the\nthe side impact protection so there's\nsome pretty big architectural changes so\nwhen it comes to this question there's a\ngood chance they will get the car\nconcept right but as you said Glenn\nthat's not necessarily enough so I feel\nlike unless Mercedes does something\nabsolutely remarkable\nthe answer to this question could be\nwell yes it will but it won't be enough\nthis isn't meant to be a an uncharitable\nquestion or misleading or anything like\nthat but it it's and it's probably\nsounds quite naive but is there a\ndifference between them getting the car\nconcept right and not getting it\nwrong uh I think we need a vend diagram\nfor this that's tricky well ultimately\nwell well you could you could say are\nyou are you saying that getting the car\nconcept right means getting it right and\ngetting somewhere near maximizing it\nwhereas not getting at wrong means being\nin the right direction but not all the\nway there is that the distinction yeah\nkind of yeah I mean if they take the\nside pods off again they really have got\nit wrong although they will tell you\nthat the side pods weren't a significant\nfactor even later uh on in the\ndevelopment of that car but that's by\nthe by that's not gone to those it's\nfunny how they're not on the car anymore\nisn't it well they they say that that\ntook performance off the car when they\ndid it but I think the thing is they got\na little bit hung up on these because\npeople were saying they were the first\norder problem the side pods which they\nweren't but the side pod shape and\nconcept follows what you're doing with\nthe underfloor and again the fact that\nthey were standing alone and they've\nmoved off it I think probably says\nsomething yeah they were getting lots of\nthings wrong that just happened to be\nthe most visible difference so we all of\nclung to it and perhaps a very trivial\none in fact but I think we will see\nnormal side pods or something\napproaching that anyway as we saw for a\nlot of this year the reason I sort of\nframed that question is that you know\nthat difference between getting it right\nand not getting it wrong is that I I I\nfeel I'm very confident Mercedes won't\nget it entirely wrong I don't I don't\nthink they're going to turn up with\nsomething that looks so dramatically\ndifferent and then Falls at the first\nhurdle again but it really does depend\non what you mean by get get that car\nconcept right and I think because of\nthis team's\nprevious um track record and the\nambition and expectation of the team get\nits car concept right has to mean\nfighting Red Bull and this time 12\nmonths ago I was happy probably in this\nsame podcast and certainly in other\npodcasts that we did before the start of\nthe season and stuff I'd written saying\nthat yeah why why shouldn't I believe\nthat Mercedes will get it right because\nthat organization is fantastic it's had\namazing success it has also succeeded\nacross different rule sets so it wasn't\njust it lucked into one really long\ncycle of rules or or anything like that\nthey were talking really positively and\noptimistically they did seem to have got\nto got a really good understanding of\nwhere things had gone wrong but but then\nthey went ahead and got it wrong again\nin a different way but and I understand\nI appreciate what Ed was saying there\nand and James Allison's explanation for\nit I I I I get that there are reasons\n2023 went wrong and and it sounds like\nvery well understood reasons why 2023\ngot wrong but what happened across 22\nand then into 23 does Dent my confidence\nthat they can eradicate all of those\nproblems at the first go in 2024 you\ndon't want to get duped again do you\nyour your faith was sh\nlast year I I think I think what what\nyou guys have said is right that you can\nget the car if they get the car concept\nright as in they make the first step but\nit's and it's the first of many steps\nthat's not enough for them you look at\nthe the rhetoric around Mercedes from\nthe very top from Toto wolf throughout\nlast year really but particularly at the\nend of last year constantly banging on\nbut not shying away from it but almost\noverdoing what a failure Mercedes have\nbeen so far and that's created a bit of\nbacklash where people are saying come on\nthis is a bit much like you still\nfinished second in the championship and\nyou're talking like you know you've been\ndown the back battling with those uh\nwith a Williams or a saber or something\nlike that but that's because of what you\nguys said that for Merced Mercedes\nexists to be fighting for wins and\nchampionships and second in 20123 more\nthan in any other year for a long time I\nthink second place really was first of\nthe losers the Mercedes\nnever I know we had the odd race where\nyou could have gone oh did Mercedes mess\nup their strategy could they have fought\na bit harder for the win there they were\nnever really in the hump for a win they\nnever turned up to a weekend where you\ncould even say they had the equal\nfastest car so for them that is that is\ntotal failure yeah and there's a test\nfor the team there in terms of how well\nhas it really responded to that whole\nprocess James Allison has also talked\nabout there being a bit of I think\nfragmentation was the way he\ncharacterized it within team that when\nthey were trying to recover they all\nkind of redoubled their efforts but\nalmost you ended up focusing so much on\nyour own little world in the part\nexactly it was a really good exactly\nyeah it wasn't sort of connected up and\nthat's been tackled but the really\ninteresting thing is that if they do get\nthe car concept right let's let's say\nall the fundamentals there the direction\nis right then it becomes a pure game of\ndevelopment it's how quickly can you get\nthat arot tracker line going up compared\nto your opposition and then it's the\nquestion of do you properly do you\nproperly understand the kind of\naggregate of the characteristics you\nneed to get because these cars are all\nabout getting performance through a\nrange of ride heights and there's all\nsorts of tradeoffs there that you have\nto apply so it's a big test even if you\nget the fundamentals right there is a\nquestion about do you really understand\nhow to how to absolutely optimize this\nthat's a big test for Mercedes and a\nvery interesting one I think a good\nseason for them would be right sort of\nconcept decent development path probably\na few wins would be you if they did that\nyou think that that's all right that's a\ndecent season good step and if they were\nto do more than that and be a genuine\ntitle threat you'd say I mean that's\nthat's pretty impressive certainly\npossible but would require a big step\nand if they were to be in the wilderness\nagain and lost that would be very very\nserious because you could kind of\nconnect what happened last year to the\nyear before cuz they hadn't quite\nrealize the full extent of it but they\nknow how wrong last year's car was they\nknow the direction they need to go and\nif if they've gone off in a completely\ndifferent direction that isn't right or\nnot understood really the core things\nthey're trying to achieve and it's very\neasy to create kind of a car that's a\nsimilar Crum of what it should be in\nthat it looks like exactly you've got\nall the same things but you don't really\nunderstand the the formula that's\ngenerating that you've got your result\nbut because you don't understand the\nword it's not really doing that and\nthere's a lot of secret so it's a big\nchallenge I think Mercedes Mercedes you\nhave to\nsay should be given a fair amount of\ncredit they're a very capable team very\ngood facilities very good people but\nit's a big test isn't it particularly\nwhen you're going up against Red\nBull well let's move on now to Ferrari\nScott is verer Ferrari on the path to\nGlory I think it's on a good path um\nit's certainly it's on the path to\nsomething yeah sure it's definitely it's\nnot on the path to Oblivion but is it\nnot on the path to Glory I want I want\nto see the map it's walking definitely\nfor I don't know if it's a prancing\nhorse at the moment but it's definitely\nit's not limping as badly as it seemed\nto be at the end of 2022 is it trotting\nbut I so that's a good way yeah I think\nso it's trotting along will it but will\nit break out into I don't know I guess a\nprance is an upgrade on a trot it\ndepends what you're trying to achieve I\nsuppose um\nwi I think um I I quite liked what I saw\nfrom Fred's Ferrari in the second half\nof of 2023 there was still still a few\nsigns of the old uh the old weaknesses\nremaining reliability a couple of um\nimperfectly run races and and that kind\nof thing but one I liked the way Ferrari\nwent about its 2023 in terms of solving\nsome problems I like the fact that they\nmade actual technical progress with the\ncar because I do think that has been a\nreal weakness of that team in in recent\nyears and they've brought stuff that\njust hasn't worked in the way that they\nwanted it to or or needed it to I quite\nlike the way Fred does seem to be quite\nneatly immune to one of the worst things\nabout Ferrari which is just the insane\nlevels of speculation and and that kind\nof stuff like he has just so little\ninteresed in it he's so he's always got\ndisdain for speculation and media\nreporting and basically us so I think\nhe's actually quite a good barrier to\nthat\nand more perhaps just as importantly he\nhe is getting the best out of char lir\nand he's making lir buy into that\nproject again so these are a bunch of\nreally good sort of broader foundational\nelements to to the organization the big\nquestion is with the significant changes\nwe're expecting from that car this year\nsimilar to Mercedes is Ferrari going to\nstrike the right balance the same this\nthe same question with Mercedes are all\nthose ingredients going to come together\nand is the changing car concept and Fred\nabsolutely hates that word as well\nactually going to result in a title\nChallenger it I think that is actually\nnow the big unknown whereas what I\nprobably would have said 12 months ago\nis that Ferrari has quite a lot of other\nstuff that they need to do better and\nget on top of and I'm seeing signs of of\nthat happening under theur and with the\nchanges that have sort of been\nimplemented Tech on the technical side\njust in terms of sheer outright\ntechnical\nFirepower I think we're at least a year\naway from Ferrari being right at the top\nand being on that path to to Glory\nbecause they've got people people\njoining but they're still not going to\nbe at full strength for probably another\nyear yeah I don't think I don't think\nthey can produce a title Challenger this\nyear because I don't think anybody's\ngoing to I think the best we can hope\nfor and we should stress this is because\nwe want this is looking at as a neutral\nwe don't have favorites um or\nunfavorites we just want we want more\nteams fighting for the wins we want the\nwins shared around I still expect Red\nBull to end up with commanding\nChampionship\nvictories but I want to see these two\nteams in particular Ferrari and Mercedes\nfinally get it together I so I don't\nthink Ferrari can win a championship\nnext year or fight for one but I I do I\nkind of feel\nlike Scott did about Mercedes a year ago\nwhere I've I've got the faith and and\nit's based on kind of the last third of\nthe 2023 season just from monser onwards\nand I might have just been getting duped\nby everything they were saying but I\njust felt like you could have more faith\nin what they were saying than you could\nin the first part of the year and I I\nreally like Fred I I dealt with him in\nthe junior ranks over a decade ago\nreally now um and I was surprised and\ndisappointed at the beginning where\nthings weren't going well because he\ninherited a bit of a mess and he just\nkind of took the uh took the route of no\njust say it's all fine or yep don't\nworry we know what we're doing and there\nwere a few times where it looked like he\nwas trying too hard to tow the party\nline I thought this isn't very Fred and\nif this is what Ferrari's done to him\nthen I don't think it's going to work\nbut he grew into his shoes his Marinello\nfitted shoes and he he came across with\na lot more conviction as the year went\non the whole team did and it was backed\nup by what felt like tangible change on\ntrack as well not only did they seem to\nmake the car better but being able to to\nbring the car back into a window where\nlir could get the best out of it I think\nthat's significant so much of what we\nsaid about Red Bull is the fact that Red\nBull does a great job of making sure\nit's a car that Max for stappen as its\nbest fastest driver can get the most out\nof it I think as great as Carlos science\nis and as good a job as he does there\nFerrari's Ferrari's absolute Peaks are\ngoing to come from the car with a number\n16 on it so the fact that they were able\nto start to turn that around before the\nend of last year gives me some Faith as\nwell so yeah this is probably the most\nupbeat I've felt about Ferrari for quite\na few years one of the things I found\nwith verer across 2023 because I I I\nunderstand where that kind of hesitance\ncomes from Glenn in terms of that all\nthe a little bit of doubt about what\nFred's Ferrari actually looks like and\nyou don't really think it looks like\nvery much in the first few months of of\n23 is that there was there I think there\nwas an awful lot of feeling out the\nsituation and just making sure he had\ntime to to to work a few things out\nbecause the first half of the Year Fred\nwas at his best when he was talking in a\nbroader sense when he was sort of\nlooking at when he was talking about\nculture when he was talking about\num the performance potential of of the\ncar and and seeing what they could\nmaximize from it over the course of the\nyear and and and that kind of stuff it\nthere was a lot in the first few months\nof last year there were very few\nspecific details about we've got this\nspecific thing wrong these are the\nthings we're going to do to address it\nwe've got this specific problem at the\nfactory and this is what we're going to\ndo to address it he he I think as early\nas which was the second round he was\nalready starting to open up a little bit\nmore about the things that weren't going\nright but there did seem it definitely\ncame across as a little bit of\nresistance to sort of publicly talking\nabout issues and how we'd fix them but I\nthink in an F1 context that's kind of\nbeen V's strategy in general he doesn't\ndo a lot of talking he prefers to\nactually just do stuff behind the scenes\nand I think he's always been that way\nyeah and and the second half of the year\nthe way that played out that's again\nkind of repeating myself a little bit\nand also a bit of what you said but\nthat's what gives me the confidence\nbecause it's like okay Fred just did\nstuff and it actually made an impact and\nhe he even got to Abu Dhabi and he was\nsaying like that doesn't really mean\nhave changed much or anything you know\nhe knows that it wasn't a one year\nthat's it fixed everything it's still a\nteam in transition and there's a lot\nthere's a lot of work that does need to\nbe done there still\nbut he just seems to have put together a\nproject that is actually internally and\nalso by the sounds of it us externally\nactually do buy into and think that\nthere is something here that is more\ndetailed beyond the N this will be all\nright the car's quick it will sort\nitself out the next one Glenn Could\nOscar piastri rest control of McLaren I\nshould stress from Lando Norris as\ndriver rather than assuring Andreas\nStellar or something a you've you've\nrobbed me of my chance to be a smart ass\nthere\num I'm sure you'll find a way I'll I'll\nbin my answer then about what I think of\nhis capabilities as team boss um let's\ntalk about the driver lineup I don't\nthink he should and that's more because\nI think if Norris is as good as\neverybody including a lot of us say he\nis then piastri shouldn't be able to do\nthat not certainly not in year two I\nthink he'll be P will be better I think\nhe needs to he needs to show that he's\nlearned something about managing race\npace and managing tires and and that\nsort of\nthing it's going to be really\ninteresting and I do think he's going to\npush Norris really hard and that's going\nto be good for Norris because it'd be\nvery easy if you stay in the same team\nfor a long time and you've always got\nthe measure of your teammates and it's\nnot a team that is out and out fighting\nfor wins and championships you might\njust get a little bit comfortable so I\nthink it's probably very well timed for\nLando to have a teammate like this I\nthink he should be up to the challenge\nand I think they they're going to be a\nphenomenal pairing this year so if the\ncar's good they are both going to be\ncausing a lot of problems for the teams\nthat we've been talking about already I\nthink the the interesting thing here is\nthat it could be one of those ones Scott\ncouldn't it that there isn't necessarily\nany Victor in this everyone always\nthinks One driver wins one driver loses\nbut we know how good Norris is and we've\nseen how good piastri already is but\ncould be so I guess that's the\nfascinating Dynamic isn't it yes I think\nthat's part of it but I think there is a\nsecond part of this question which is\nWill Norris want to stay at McLaren and\nI think that is a key question that gets\nresolved in 20124 it might get resolved\nvery very early it might get resolved\ntowards the end it might spill into 25\nbut 24 will be the foundation of the\nresolution because\n2023 was absolutely critical for McLaren\njust realigning itself with Norris's own\ntrajectory there there was a problem\ndeveloping there which was that just as\nMcLaren was starting to fade and looked\nless convincing than at any point during\nNorris's career that it would get to the\nfront in Formula 1 Norris was very very\nclearly ready to fight at the front in\nFormula 1 Norris is under under contract\nuntil the end of\n2025 but his desire to leave would only\nhave grown his frustration would only\nhave grown had 2023 carried on the way\nit started in those first eight races or\nso which were really really frustrating\nfrustrating and and tough to put up with\nso if we take it at face value what\nNorris has said what Zack Brown has said\nAndreas Stellar has said that\nrelationship is really strong and\nprobably a lot stronger than it had any\nright to be in the first couple of\nmonths of 23 so Norris and McLaren are\non a path again towards another renewal\nand a longer term contract but if\nMcLaren takes a step back again in 2024\nif piastri does particularly well and\nputs Norris Under Pressure if something\nchanges elsewhere like Daniel Ricardo\nhas a mega Target Alpha to Yuki Coda\ncontinues to be someone Red Bull's got\nno interest in and Sergio Perez is for\nthe exit door at Red Bull Racing in\nafter 24 Red Bull will make another\neffort to sign Norris and at that point\nNorris might be moved to think actually\nhas have I given McLaren all of the time\nand patience and everything that I need\nto give them and if any situation like\nthat emerges whether Norris is\ndefinitely for the exit door possibly\nfor the exit door having his head turned\nwhatever that's where pastri can come in\nand rest control as well because why\nwould McLaren put everything behind\nNorris if they think there is a good or\neven decent chance of losing him at the\nend of 25 when piastri is signed up for\n26 is in in a different phase of his\ncareer and not to say that Norris is\ndislaw in any way but the the\ningredients for pastry's loyalty to\ncontinue they're kind of already there\nwhereas McLaren needs to do a little bit\nmore convincing to keep Norris on board\nlonger term this is a conversation for\nanother podcast but very quickly I I\ndon't understand the the Norris Red Bull\nlinks and the the Red Bull the in I know\nthey've spoken well about him I don't\nunderstand why he's the sort of driver\nthey'd look for unless they don't think\nMax is long for for F1 if they if they\nthink ma is going to go then you get\nLando in early and he's kind of there\nand you put up with maybe having two\ndrivers who are a bit too equal for\ntheir liking if they think Max is going\nto stick around for a long time I just\nthink they're going to want to find\nanother number two and want a more\nreliable number two than Perez but\nthat's a discussion for another time I\nwanted to pick up on something we said\nearlier that you don't always have to\nhave a loser in a teammate battle in\nthis McLaren battle I think piastri\nwon't lose uh as long as he makes some\nprogress so if if Lando still beats\npastre but pastre is better that's good\neveryone looks good everyone's happy if\npastri beats Norris or gets ahead of\nNorris then I do think Norris loses I\nthink his his reputation that has only\nclimbed during his time in F1 will face\nits first dip and then there will be\nquestions and actually then maybe he\nwould be ideal for Red Bull as a number\ntwo if they decide that he's not quite\nat the level of his current McLaren\nteammate so I think there is some risk\nfor Norris but I suspect that that it\nwill just sharpen him up and and make\nhim deliver consistently at a high level\nthere's also a need for him to show that\nsome of the problems he had in the Final\nPhase of 2023 were more car related than\ndriver related because there were too\nmany qualifying mistakes he he admitted\nit he was very harsh on himself and\nmaybe overly harsh on some occasions but\nperfectly reasonably harsh on on others\nhe needs to he needs to tidy that up and\nthe the progress that McLaren makes of\nits car could go a long way to resolving\nthat because if the car is clearly a\nmore consistent compliant machine in\nqualifying much less so in the race it's\nit's in qualifying when it's on a knife\nedge that the problems arise piastri\nbecause that's where he absolutely\nexcelled in his rookie season was\nqualifying piastri will expose any\nlingering Norris weakness if that car\nisn't the problem anymore let's say it\nwas the main factor towards the end of\n23 with Norris's rate of mistakes\npiastri H is is good enough and fast\nenough to show when Norris isn't getting\nthe most out of a consistently good car\nso I think there is also a little bit of\npressure there for Norris to just just\njust tidy up that L if he's got any\nrough edges it's those qualifying\nmistakes they might not be his fault but\nwe'll hopefully find out in 24 whether\nhe's got on top of the stuff that he's\ncontributing to and the more competitive\nthe McLaren is the more intense that\nbattle between those two will be so\ncould be a really really exciting\nstoryline if the McLaren is able to\nfight for race wins on a regular\nbasis let's move on now to question five\nScott is Aston Martin the real deal yeah\nthis is a very very important year for\nfor for Aston Martin as a whole there\nwas the big step obviously for the start\nof 2023 which was less it I I think I\nsaid this quite a few times at the start\nof the year and then through the season\nit was actually it was less of a\nshocking step as perhaps the outright\nresults made it look because they that\nteam had actually ended 22 in a better\nposition it looked in the championship\nand in terms of I guess if you're\nlooking at it a bit more casually\nbecause actually by the end of 2022 it\nwas quite regularly sniping for points\nit was probably the it probably had the\nthe fifth fastest car but it didn't look\nlike that it was in in Championship\nsense I think it was seventh and it had\nonly sort of progressed into seventh so\nit it wasn't like a blockbuster oh yeah\nthis didn't look on the surface like\nthis is a team ready to make a massive\nlead they walked through an open door as\nwell didn't they left by Mercedes and\nFerrari exactly so what you had was a\nteam that was actually really by the end\nof 22 probably the fifth best team in F1\nor the fifth best car then at the start\nof 23 two and well three of the teams\nahead of it dropped the ball in some way\none because it's Alpine and two because\nFerrari and Mercedes just didn't do as\ncompetitive a job so there was an\nopportunity there a bit of lwh hanging\nfruit for Aston Martin to make a a very\ngood step but not a totally\ntransformative dramatic one but the\nresults were transformative and dramatic\nthen it's not going to have the\nopportunity to do that again for 24 or\nit shouldn't unless the answers to the\nquestions we've asked before this are uh\ncan Mercedes get his car concept right\nabsolutely not is Vil's Ferrari on the\npath to Glory absolutely not could\npastri rest control of McLaren no\nbecause it's going to implode that's the\nonly way that Aston makes another\nmassive step from season end to to\nseason start but what's important I\nthink for this year is to show something\nthat I think you and I have talked about\nquite a lot Ed and I know that you've\nsort of arrowed in on this as something\nto prove is whether or not that\ntechnical structure and and what they do\ncan create Good original ideas that it\nthen develops through the season because\nit's kind of one thing to have almost\ncherry-picked a few of the best ideas\nelsewhere and then done your best\ninitial go at at consolidating all of\nthat and improving it in your own way\nbut I'm a little bit worried by the lack\nof progress that they made relative to\nrivals in in in 23 and Ed I'm I'm\nforgetting how you often phrase it but\nthat feels like the biggest question\nmark for me it's that kind of original\nideas and actually showing the flexing\nthe technical muscles so to speak yeah\nthey've got to show they can self-\nsustain their progression with their own\ndevelopment work their own ideas their\nown concept drives Etc and it's that\nthis is the test of what the team can do\nwhich is why I think the 24 car is a a\nhuge huge test and actually I think it's\nit's the toughest question on this list\nthat we're talking about today to\nactually come up with an answer to\nbecause we haven't yet seen the evidence\nthe evidence will be in the 24 Aston\nMartin we can't really predict because\nthat could be a car that's right up\nthere or it could be a car that\nregresses further and is and is messing\naround fighting for sort of back half of\nthe grid if things go wrong it's a\ndifferent side of the same coin with the\nother teams with the other teams we\nasking them to prove to us that they do\nare finally understand what they've done\nwrong and where they need to go with\nAston Martin we're asking him to prove\nthat they do understand where to take\nwhat they did in 2023 so there's still a\nlevel of we're not certain that they\nknow exactly what the next steps are\nit's kind of okay you did a really good\njob to get to this point do you know why\nyou got there and do you know where the\ndirection is from here so it's it's this\nit's you can bundle it into the same\nquestion about do you really understand\nwhat's going on here it just so happens\nthat unlike the other big teams Aston\nMartin at least got to this stage before\nthey did the one thing that did\nencourage me about their 2023 the second\nhalf of the season was the way they kind\nof unpicked the problems that they'd\nalmost meandered into in the second half\nof the year and okay the the the Brazil\nqualifying result and race result was\nbit of an outlier compared to the races\nthat followed but it was a bit more\nconvincingly the fifth best team again\nin this the end at the end of the year I\nmean obviously alfat and Alpine had had\ntheir moments but it just felt like\nAston Martin had I I feared that it was\non a trajectory that had it fading out\nof that even points by the end of the\nyear like a real reverse of the 2022\ntrajectory that was what was concerning\nme but it did feel like they started to\nunpick that quite effectively and when\nyou consider that one of their targets\nwas to to to undo some of the negative\ncharacteristics that caught Lance stroll\nout in particular and strolls form over\nthose final races while not stunning and\nstill too weak in qualifying apart from\nin Brazil it was better it was a lot\nmore like what we saw in the first few\nraces of the Year ironically when Lance\nwas at his weakest physically um and\nthat sort of again suggested okay well\nyou had a you had a spec specific goal\nwith the car here and you seem to have\nachieved it because strolls form changed\nquite dramatically so\na bit of encouragement from that and and\nthen obviously just another part of the\nsubsection of the question entirely is\nwhat happens with the drivers because I\ndon't think there is any doubt after 23\nthat Alonzo is still in a more than good\nenough position to lead a team like this\nand to deliver when the results are\nthere that the jury is very much still\nout on on on on on Lance I think there's\nI think there's just about enough\nevidence for you to say that he he could\ndo he could do some good results like\nhe's he's done enough he's done enough\nsort of solid work with a few flashes\nhere and there to know that if that car\nis to his liking and is very competitive\nstroll is not going to be absolutely\nnowhere he's not going to be getting\nknocked out in q1 in a car that is you\nknow top five on the grid week in week\nout or anything like that he's clearly\nnot a hopeless Grand Prix driver but\nhe's not on Alonzo's level and is he\nreally good enough if Aston Martin\nproves it is the real deal and is in a\nposition to to fight for second third or\nfourth in the championship is stro going\nto be there supporting Alonzo and making\na legitimate proper contribution to that\nthat again I I think there's a there's a\nbig question mark against it yeah and I\nthink again Aston Martin is the team\nthat has probably the widest range of\npossible outcomes in terms of its\ncompetitiveness this year which is makes\nit what makes it so interesting the hope\nis that it is strong because again\nthat's a team that has good quality\npeople they've invested in a lot of the\nright places so the ingredients should\nbe there\nit's really a question of whether it\nCeres properly and fully it's done it's\ndone some of that as was shown last year\nbut whether last year was a good\nintermediate step to better things in\nwhich case it was a good year or whether\nit was uh a bit of a a oneoff caused by\nConfluence of circumstances and they\nregress in which case in which case last\nyear was a bad year is the big question\nso yeah lots to unravel about Aston\nMartin and it's going to take the car on\ntrack for to do\nthat let's move on to our final set of\nquestions now we're kind of working our\nway down the grid a bit Glenn is there\nany point in Alpine the most\ndisrespectful of the questions on here\nbut perhaps not with not without good\nreason given it's uh static form of the\npast half decade or so yeah I could just\nsay no and then we'll move on and save\nourselves some time um but I would like\nto explain slightly why this is beyond\nthe team's flatlining performance or\nsomewhat flatlining performance and I\nthink that since this team became\nAlpine nobody as far as I can tell from\nlike the engagement we can see from our\naudience nobody cares about this team as\nAlpine nobody knows what Alpine is um we\nspent the first six months uh having\nfans telling us that we were wrong for\nnot saying Alpine um so that there's\nnothing there's nothing there for people\nto care about so if the team stays in\nthe\nMidfield people people don't don't want\nto read about it they don't want to\nwatch videos about it they probably\nwon't listen to a a full podcast about\nthe team the team even though you it's\nvery easy to forget this is still a\nWorks F1 team and when it was called\nRenault that's that's a big name with um\nwider Automotive recognition but also\nmassive F1 history Alpine it just sounds\nlike a sponsor to most people so I get\nwhat probably why they did it was it was\na way of keeping the Renault group in F1\nand oh we'll use it to promote this new\nthis well I was going to say new brand\nAlpine's been around for decades this\nbrand that we want to reinvigorate but\nit has created a situation coupled with\num their\nperformances and with a a driver lineup\nthat's solid but unspectacular it has\nmade them a bit Anonymous in the middle\nof the grid and like I say that's for\nmore reasons than purely just\nperformance the the the logic behind the\nthe the Alpine Rebrand gave the team\nreally really nice like basement level\nof what would be a success in Formula 1\nbecause a brand like Renault doesn't get\nthat much out of being the fifth sixth\nbest team in in Formula 1 but a nothing\nbrand like Alpine still gets enormous\nmarketing benefits just by being in F1\nso almost just just by existing and\ngiving the team that platform or giving\nthe brand that platform has value that\nRenault just doesn't get in in in the\nsame way that that was great because\nthat was a that was a really sensible as\nyou as you alluded to Glenn almost like\nfuture proofing of the Renault group's\nparticipation in Formula 1 because they\nwould get so much more out of it in a\nrelative sense by having Alpine there\nthe problem is that seems to have just\ntranslated entirely into renault's\nattitude towards the team's performance\nwhich is just well we're here and we're\ngetting something out of just being here\nso why would we put more money in why\nwould we put the right effort in why\nwould we have the priorities in the\nright order to actually make us success\nof this team and I think we've said it\nquite a few times now that organization\nnow as Alpine I don't I didn't feel this\nway about it when it was still Renault\nbut that organization right now is a\nmarketing exercise with a racing team\nattached to it it's not the other way\naround and I sort of asked Alonzo about\nthis at the end of the 2023 season and\nsaid there's got to be very different at\nAston Martin because that is very much\nyou know there's a huge marketing\nelement around that huge commercial\nelement you know really really leaning\non the the brand and um businesso\nbusiness relationships with various\npartners and stuff like this but there's\nnot so so there's this whole potential\ncommercial circus around Aston Martin\nbut it's a racing team at heart it's a\nit's a it's a team it's a program with\nserious ambition and a fairly logical\nintended path to to get that Alpine and\nRenault don't don't have that at all so\nyou ask is there any point in the team\nyes there is from a comp commercial\nsense but competitively from a\nperformance level less of a point than\never and it it frustrates me because\nthere are really good people within that\norganization and end stones are uh got a\nfantastic trap record across multiple\niterations and I'm sure that the people\nat viry that do the engine that they're\nobviously not no hopers there's loads of\nloads of effort and talent and ideas\nthere but you just have an organization\nbehind it that just doesn't to me and I\nthink actually Pat fry might have said\nsomething like this at the end of 23 as\nhe's now gone to to Williams from aling\nthere's no motivation no desire or push\nfrom from the owner really to be\nanything more than the fourth or best\nfifth best team in Formula One because\nwell they get everything they need to\nout of F1 by being at that level so why\nwould why aim higher why make it harder\nfor yourself why make it more expensive\nthat and it's not just us asking if\nthere's any point it's kind of feels\nlike Renault is asking that is there any\npoint in being any anything more than\nAlpine ultimately as we talked about\nbefore the ownership has has often been\na question mark when it comes to run no\nowned F1 teams the engine projects\ngenerally have done pretty well when\nthey've certainly when they've been\nStandalone obviously the Turbo Hybrid\nera hasn't been brilliant necessarily\nfor for Renault and that's been going on\na while now so perhaps you could say in\nmore recent years that's questionable as\nwell but yeah it just comes down to is\nthat team being given the best\nopportunity cuz one of the things that\nPat fry said when he was talking about\nwhy he left he said that he didn't\nreally feel that otar saf now have been\ngiven much of a chance to uh to take\nthings on and and his Focus was firmly\non the ownership in terms of that not\ngiving the impression that it had the\ngenuine ambition to move better than\nfourth and then of course last year they\nfinished six and not just six but Alpine\nwas so profoundly six so they weren't in\nthat battle at the back with the four\nteams they weren't anywhere near the top\nfive they were just this very very very\nno man's Landy kind of sixs and that's\nthat's pretty poor and while there were\nsome what I'd call very gentle positives\nafter the change they had midseason they\nslightly up their yield in terms of\npoints per race and that kind of thing\nthere were some gently positive things\nabout the way the team was operating\nTrackside and uh Bruno faman the interim\nteam boss who incidentally seems like he\nmight be becoming less of an interim\nteam boss and might be there for a while\nin terms of running the team said that\nhe he felt the the the upgrade that they\nrushed through for Las Vegas to make it\nmore competitive there than it was in\nMonza was a big tangible benefit of\npushing on and being a bit more\naggressive but these are all you know\nthat they're they sort of tentative\ngreen shoots rather than signs of\noverwhelming progress so that that's the\nthing I want to see something something\nmore convincing than just sort of these\nlittle ups and downs bobbing in the\nMidfield one they they're fourth one\nyear they're sixth one year they're\nfifth it all amounts to much the same\nthing it's just not really going\nanywhere even though a lot of the\ningredients are there one of the things\nI would just to really sort of summarize\nthe issue that I have with it is uh\nbackto back effectively press releases\nfrom the organization in mid December\none came the day before the other first\nyou had an announcement that David bivio\nwas finally leaving and there I can\nguarantee there has to be some people\nlistening to this podcast now that had\nno idea bivio was still there\nafter his slightly curious but left\nfield and kind of brilliant in a way\nswitch from the world of Moto GP um\nAnonymous threeyear stint sidelined\nafter 12 months but really he'd been\nsidelined much earlier than that and the\nman that was hired to be the head of\ntrack side operations effectively or the\ntrack side leader as the racing director\nended up being in this absolutely\nnebulous um racing expansion Project's\nrole that sort of put him in charge of\nthe Alpine Academy but he wasn't really\nit was it was n\nand so they announced fair you know it\nwasn't totally perfunctory as a as a\nstatement but they announced his\ndeparture the next morning there's this\nbig press release about cinin Bloody\nzadan welcoming Alpine in Madrid and\nposing for photos because he's an Alpine\nAmbassador for go for absolute for I\nthey're very very proud of it and\nthey're very excited about it but as far\nas I can tell I I don't see how I don't\nsee why a serious F1 team or operation\nneed needs that affiliation so there's\nlots of photos he poses with the drivers\nhe poses with alpine Academy members he\nposes next to Alpine cars and stuff like\nthis and does takes them on a tour and\nthey play a little game of football and\nthat kind of it's all very nice but it's\npure Rena group it's pure Alpine F1 in\nthat it's all Style no substance and\nthat to me that ju to position really\ngood person who you got nowhere near\ngetting the most out of has left the\nnext day big song and dance about this\npointless big money big name Ambassador\nshowcasing that like that's their\npriority and that that's why I just have\nwhatever faith I have on the endstone\nside really good people in the\norganization ver side whatever that is\nthat attitude is what we'll keep holding\nthat back and I think we will see that\nagain 2024 might be one of the years\nwhere they have a nice little upward\ntick in their trajectory but they won't\ngo any further than being probably the\nfourth best team and they'll probably\ncome tumbling down fairly soon after you\nmentioned Ed I think that um they were a\nNo Man's Land sixth that's last in class\nfor a team like this you know in 2023\nthe four teams behind were in their own\nmini battle to not be last so if if\nyou're if you're a team as big as as Al\nI need called them Renault if you're a\nteam as big as Alpine is if you are\nrenault's Works team and you're Sixth\nand those are the only teams you're\nbeating you're last in class so that's\nabout year I wouldn't even say they\nlasting class cuz I think they fell out\nof that class they're a drift of the\nclass yeah they're in their own little B\nClass there's an a class and a cclass\nand there's just the Alpine class on its\nown hey winning a class of one is still\na win well that's true there'll be\nplenty of poth hunters in Motorsport who\nwill tell you that but although although\nthere was a brief spell of races when\nAston Martin kind of dropped into the\nAlpine battle it was yeah very lonely\nseason for uh for LP I hope there's\nreasons to be more positive that for the\nfor this team than we see than we're\nsaying here I really do but yeah they\nneed to show something and I think we\ntouched on the the areas that that are\nholding it back and it's not necessarily\nthe actual nuts and bolts of the team as\nsuch let's move on now to our seventh\nquestion Scott will Saba be any less\npointless slight variation questions are\ngetting more and more brutal aren't they\nyou can tell Ed just like lost Ed just\nhe he started this podcast being the one\nthat was look being the glass half full\nlook at 2024 but it feel was like at\nsome when this podcast outline was being\ndrafted Ed was just like running out of\nenthusiasm for 2024 already or question\neight he's going to resign or maybe it's\njust as a little bit of a giveaway to\nthe fact that we might not be recording\nthis in the in the early minutes of 2024\nmaybe the maybe 2023 had just started to\ntake its toll a little bit too much on\nEd as he got down to the um the the the\ntuggers of the of the group I I feel I\ndeny that allegation strongly Scott what\njust happened is I i' got further into\nthe New Year's Eve rivalries while\nwriting obviously took a little bit of\ntime and yeah the questions just\ngradually got a bit more Larry so this\nis the question that you write at about\nquarter to midnight in a weather spoon\nI'm not sure it's quite that\ndesperate um anyway right so speaking of\ndesperate let's talk about salba um\nobviously it's um it's no longer the\nfaux manufacture that was Alpha Romeo um\nand it's in this kind of holding phase\nnow before it becomes Audi in 2026 it\nhonestly this is going to be a bit of a\ntreading water for a year or two and I'm\nsure the team will say that's not the\ncase and and to a degree it won't be\nbehind the scenes there's going to be\nreally really important work going on to\nget ready for 26 on track there's going\nto be really important work there as\nwell because they need to start showing\nimprovements and actually making\nprogress there's been a little bit of\nnoise about recognizing that they\nultimately had they were one of the\nteams that got the concept wrong and had\nto re address that quite substantially\nin the form of a brand new car for 2024\nrather than you know evolve it through\nthe year and then try to kick on so\npotentially that there is scope here for\na reasonable step straight out the\nblocks in 2024 because a lot of the car\nI suspect will change but based on based\non its recent track record based on the\nfact that it's still in that kind of\ntransitional phase to become Audi's\nWorks team and even though elements of\nthe facilities are are fantastic there\nstill a fairly small organization and\nJames Keys arrived obviously he had\nissues in terms of trying to make\nMcLaren what exactly what s was trying\nto become and and lost his job there\nhe's been the second half of 23 and\nstarted to get his feet under the table\nbut it just feels it feels like it's at\nleast a year too soon to start to see\nwhat this organization might become so I\ndon't have hugely high hopes for it I'm\nfascinated to see how Audi feels about\nwhat you described there is going to be\na very difficult very odd potentially\nAnonymous couple years before this team\nbecomes fullon Audi are they willing to\nwrite it off on track because they're\ndoing they believe they're doing all the\nright things off track or does there\ncome a point particularly within\nboardrooms and that sort of thing where\nif it's going really wrong if sa becomes\nrooted to the bottom of the championship\nbecause those teams it's battling with\nget their act together will there be\npeople going well what have we bought\nhere what are we buying into we've\nbought this team and it's getting\nprogressively worse since we bought it\nwill that then mean that there's Audi\npressure to get a bit more involved\nunofficially to turn things around\nbefore they come in in 2026 I have very\nlittle faith in saber at the moment\nunfortunately because they looked good\nat the start of this rule set because\nthey had what the only car that was out\nor close to the weight limit and really\nas far as as far as really matters it's\njust been a gradual decline since then\nas everyone else has got their act\ntogether and very very little by the way\nof real shoots of progress so I'm just\nI'm fascinated about how Ali's going to\nfeel about that because 2026 is still a\nvery long way away the I guess the glass\nhalf full way of looking at that is that\num Audi's if it's if its team gradually\ngets worse in this period Then Audi is\ngoing to look Mega if it comes in into\n2026 and even and even sets it up as the\nfourth or fifth team cuz it's going to\nlook like an absolute it'll be the anti-\nMercedes the opposite of Mercedes where\nyou buy a title winning team and\nsuddenly turn it into what like the\nfourth or fifth team in Formula One at\nthe the first attempt I have a suspicion\nthat Saba won't get that bad and I have\na suspicion I also don't think Ali will\ndo that good a job straight away yeah I\nwas about to say I'm not 100% convinced\nthey'll be that's why I think it's\nimportant the 24 is at least the start\nof seeing some progress because I think\nwhatever you see in 26 even though\nyou'll have the new engine and you will\nhave a new rule set a new new set of car\nrules to try and put all of the the the\nthe fruits of the labor of the last few\nyears into effect for a brand new set of\nregulations it's an opportunity to make\na big leap I think this is the\nfoundation right and I don't it it has\nto get to a good level but it won't get\nto that level this year that that's my\nconcern and ultimately with its dri\nlineup what why would you expect\nanything spectacular I mean Val botas\nwill probably have a few really nice\nheadline grabbing Saturdays and the odd\ngreat conversion of that into decent\npoints on\nSundays and that's about as good as it\nwill get from the drivers or am I being\ntoo harsh Ed given that this is\nobviously salber is a team that you have\na soft spot for well I think you know we\nbotas did produce some strong weekends\nlast year sometimes on fairly hopeless\nones for the team so it didn't show\nthrough that well he can be a little bit\nerratic Joe in a quick enough cut car\ncan be a solid Point scorer so yeah it's\nnot a stunning lineup but it it it could\nhave some decent uh decent Peaks but\nwhat I want to see from that team is\njust an improvement from what they did\nlast year because it just wasn't enough\nit was very erratic last year and\nthey're not anywhere near maximizing the\npotential of the team that they are\nright now so that's the two things they\nneed to do they need to you know expand\nthe team get more people and improve the\nfacilities Etc but they also need to get\nbetter at maximizing the performance\npotential they do have because those two\nthings together are what will turn that\nteam into the race wining operation Audi\nwants it to be down the line let's move\non to our final one now Glenn we're\nmoving into the world of the driver\nMarket can Williams keep Alex alurn I'm\nglad your questions have calmed down and\nit's not just um what's the point of\nWilliams\num but I don't I don't think I have good\nnews for them I think if uh if Albin\nreproduces what we saw from him in\n2023 I think he's going to outgrow\nWilliams and yes Williams is hopefully\ngoing in the right direction James vs\nseems to be doing a really good job and\nhas got Grand plans\nbut the way I look at it is can Alex\nalurn afford to wait for those grand\nplans to come to fruition probably not\nand I don't think he should if the right\noffer comes along what he has done to\nhis reputation is phenomenal to going\ninto Williams absolutely brilliant job I\ndon't necessarily think that's going to\nget him a top top race winning car you\nknow they're not I don't think those\nteams are going to be fighting over him\nbut better Midfield teams might be and\nthere's always you always get the odd\nunexpected vacancy when the driver\nMarket's a bit volatile and I hope the\ndriver Market is more interesting than\nit was this winter when nothing happened\nso I just think he will have better\noffers and as much as we all love\nloyalty\nthis is a ruthless Sport and if Williams\nfelt they could get do better than Alex\nalurn they would replace him so if he\ncan do better than Williams I think he\nshould go somewhere else and I like I\nsay I I just think that the timeline\nisn't going to quite line up so I can't\nsit here and say that he should\ndefinitely ride the wave with Williams\nbecause I think that that that progress\nis going to be slow well and also he's\ngot to be aware of the passage of time\ndoesn't he in terms of he's not an old\ndriver\nexactly exactly but he's he's sort of\nentering F1 middle age now so this next\nmove he makes it could be actually the\nbiggest move he makes in terms of the\nfinancial uh package he gets it could be\nwith he's going to be in a strong enough\nposition in the dri Market probably\nparticularly if he moves to an upward\nmobile team ra upwardly mobile team\nrather than one that's established at\nthe front it could be a good long-term\ncontract as well so he needs both to\nmaximize his earning potential and his\nopportunity here because Williams's\nrecovery it's going to take quite a long\ntime he'll be able to\nbe he'll be able to form a firm judgment\non it because he's on the inside so\nhe'll have a fair idea of how long it\ncould take Williams to get up there so\nhe will know whether it's worth\nconsidering staying there but he will\nalso have to do what is best for his own\ncareer ultimately he's given Williams as\nof now two extremely good years he will\nprobably have given them three extremely\ngood years by the end of the current\ncontract so yeah he he will have a high\nmarket value and obviously Scott is all\npart of what could be a quite volatile\nMarket couldn't it for 25 there's\npotential for there to be lots of\nchanges and Alburn will be one of the\ncentral players in it I can see him for\nquite a few months being linked to all\nsorts of opportunities while other chess\npieces are being moved around yeah it\nkind of um one of the things I've\nactually really enjoyed hearing from\nAlon at times over the last sort of 12\nmonths or so is just how honest and\nblunt he has been about his age and like\nhe s said like everyone calls me young\nand I know but I'm not in an F1 driver\nsense so he's not I don't think he's in\na I'll give you a comparison botas and\nPerez could conceivably have done their\nlast proper deals in in Formula 1 they\nmight have another deal in them but they\nneither of them have a lucrative deal\nleft in in their locker I think they can\nextend their careers but they don't have\na big one I think a driver like Carlos\nSS and maybe albon's in the same bracket\nor a little bit of a slightly different\none but once you get a driver that's\nsort of coming to the end of their 20s\nand signs I think has a couple of years\non on Alum SS I feel like is looking at\nhis his last big contract like that's\nwhat I think SS wants to do I think\nideally he'd do that with Ferrari now\nand get a three or fouryear deal Bank of\ncash take him into his early 30s and\nthen decide what to do from there he\nhe's looking for something like that\nalurn I think is trying to put himself\nin a position to get the first of those\nbig deals if that makes sense the the\none that puts him back into much more of\na prominent position in um in Formula 1\nhe's already reestablished himself as a\nrelevant and important player in the\ndriver Market but in terms of the chance\nto get bigger results the chance to get\na bigger payday that's what the next\ndeal is about and then there should be\none after that as well so this is a\nreally important phase of of Alban's\ncareer and how that ties in with the\nothers your you know your your your\ncareer fading slightly older drivers\nlike a Perez or or or a bot ass a signs\nwho's in a similar kind of situation but\nalso trying to throw his weight around\nthe potential retirement of big guns\nlike Hamilton and and Alonzo there's an\nawful this is a very it's a very\nthreedimensional driving Market Market\nwhich is the complete opposite as Glenn\nsaid of one where for the first time in\nhistory we're going to start a season\nwith exactly the same Driver Line as we\nended it I would be I would be I would\nbe stunned in 12 if in 12 months time we\nare looking ahead to the same grid yet\nagain yeah I don't think that'll be the\ncase for reference Alban turns 28 in\nMarch and science are you comparing him\nto is 18 months older so anent the pair\nof them exactly exactly but it is F1\nmiddle age and it's a short career and\nit's your job as a drive to make the\nmost of it especially as Alban hasn't\nexactly been raking it in for the past\nfew years with uh with Williams he's\nmaking a decent living certainly by\nnormal standards but yeah he's not\nsetting himself up for life yet let's\nput it that way and he needs to with the\nnext one and given he's been so close to\nF1 Oblivion when he was on the scrap\nHeap as Red Bull Reserve he knows how\nimportant it is to make the most of that\nwell hopefully we've managed to address\nthe big questions going into the season\nit's very very hard to give any\ndefinitive answers but the next 12\nmonths will answer them all we will know\nabsolutely everything come this time\nnext year so that's something to look\nforward to and of course the race F1\npodcast will be with you every step of\nthe way so thanks very much to Scott and\nGlenn for your Insight head to the\nrace.com don't forget the hyphen plenty\nto read there on the world of F1

    "transcript": "(smooth music)\n- All right, now that\nwe're back down to Earth\nafter all of that Vision Pro launch stuff,\nI've had a chance to go back\nand re-pick up some of the things\nthat I was testing that got, like,\ninterrupted by that week of chaos,\nand there is some really good stuff.\nThe OPPO Find X7 Ultra design\nI really like more than I expected.\nThe Zenbook Duo, the full screen,\ndual screen laptop for\n2024, is kind of sick.\nAnd there's some other stuff\nthat is better than expected.\nBut the one that stood out to\nme maybe the most of them all\nis this guy right here, the OnePlus 12.\nThis may have flown a\nlittle bit under the radar,\nI mean, with everything\nthat's been going on,\nbut it's gotten some\nimprovements from last year,\nand it is priced very competitively.\nMatter of fact, let's\njust start with that. 799.\nAnd you also get a free\nupgrade to the 16 gigs of RAM,\nhalf terabyte model for\nthat price if you pre-order.\nIt's literally already marked\ndown to that on Amazon,\nso I'll have a link below.\nFlagship price, yes,\nbut when it's competing\ntheoretically against\nsome of the ultra phones, 1,000, 1,200,\n$1,300, then suddenly, it's\nkind of in the category of, uh,\ndare I say, flagship killer?\nSo look, it's nearly\nthe same on the outside.\nThey found what they like and\nthey're keeping it consistent.\nSame shapes, same camera bump circle\nthat kind of melts into the side\nwith these neural details around it.\nIt's still Gorilla Glass 5 on the back,\nand there's a new set\nof colors and textures,\nbut in general, you'd\nbe forgiven for thinking\nit's nearly the same as last year.\nOr maybe you wouldn't, but\ndon't let that fool you.\nUpfront, this screen\nis I think the biggest\nnoticeable physical\ndifference from last year.\nIt gets way brighter, up\nto 1,600 nits outdoors,\nand it's hitting crazy numbers now.\n4,500 nits peak HDR brightness.\nBasically, it's super impressive\nand extremely readable\noutdoors and in any light.\nBut it also gets extremely dim too.\nNow, I don't like that it's\nthis curved over the edges,\nlike, you can see the light fall off\nand the extra reflections\nthat come with that,\nbut basically, from corner\nto corner, this 6.8 inch,\n1440p LTPO Pro XDR display\nis a real upgrade over last year.\nSo then the rest of the\nupgrades to this phone\nare definitely a case of a\nbunch of little changes all,\nlike, stacking up on top of each other\nto equal a large\ndifference from last year.\nDoes that make sense?\nLike, that's what\nsmartphones are nowadays.\nI remember reviewing the OnePlus 1\nand then the OnePlus 2 the next year,\nand just the gigantic total shift,\nbig direction changes\nbetween those two phones.\nNowadays, it's just about, like,\nfinding a bunch of clever little things\nand stacking a bunch of\nlittle improvements on top of\neach other, just make the user\nexperience a little better.\nSo obviously, if you're\ngonna be a flagship killer,\nyou gotta have the newest chip inside.\nSo it does, it's the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.\nNot that you'll notice a\nwhole ton of difference\nside by side with a\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2 phone,\nbut this phone does have\nmuch better cooling as well,\nso it's giving them some\nheadroom to play with\nslightly boosted clock speeds,\nand it's benchmarking right behind\nthe gaming phones and the S24 Ultra.\nIn real world use, that just\nmeans this phone is super fast,\nreally, really fluid, it's\na smooth phone all the time.\nLike, this is something OnePlus\nhas done really well for a long time,\neven with high performance mode being off\nin the battery settings by default.\nBut speaking of battery, this phone\nis definitely prioritizing battery,\nsuper long battery life, over, like,\nultra high end performance numbers\nand getting every last\nFPS out of the thing,\nand as a result, this is a battery champ.\nFirst of all, you just\nstart with a huge capacity.\nSo it's got one of the\nbiggest batteries ever\nin a OnePlus flagship.\nIt's now a 5,400 milliamp hour battery.\nThat's bigger than a lot of other phones\nthat are ultras now.\nAnd you better believe\nthey've kept their trademarked\nSuper Fast Charging also.\nSo, it's technically a split battery,\nit's dual 2,700 milliamp hours.\nand it can juice up at 80 watts wired.\nThis combination of huge\nbattery, awesome battery life,\nprioritization of battery length,\nand ultra fast charging\nhonestly makes this\nat least a contender to\nthink about right now\nfor battery champ of the year.\nMatter of fact, if you\njust leave this phone\nand all of its out the box settings,\nmeaning not in high performance mode,\njust regular performance mode by default,\n1080p, which it is out the box,\nand then just auto frame rate,\nyou can get two full light\ndays out of this phone.\nAnd then when you finally\ndo get down to near zero,\nyou can charge up to half\nbattery in like 12 minutes.\nIf you wanna go all the way full,\nthat's only gonna take about half an hour.\nIt's just so easy.\nAnd on top of all of that,\nthere is up to 50 watt wireless charging.\nSo if you've got a\ncompatible air booth charger,\nyou obviously have to buy that separately,\nbut the OnePlus 11 didn't\neven have wireless charging\nat all, so this is a gigantic improvement.\nI almost wanna get greedy\nand also wish that there was\nQi2 support for wireless charging,\nbut I don't know about you,\nbut Qi2 has felt like it's off to\na weird, rocky start,\nespecially this year.\nIt's been surprisingly\nuncommon for any phones\nto support Qi2 with the\nmagnets and wireless charging.\nThis is likely because there seems to be\na 15 watt charging limit with Qi2 for now,\nso if you wanna do fast wireless charging,\nyou aren't doing Qi2.\nSo yeah, no Qi2 wireless, no magnets,\nbut very, very fast charging.\nEither way, way better display,\nbetter chip, better battery,\nand also now the cameras\nhave gotten an upgrade.\nNow, I'm just gonna say,\ncameras have been a relatively weak point\nfor OnePlus's highest end\nphones for a while now.\nWe've always wanted to\ncall them flagship killers,\nbut people love cameras\nin flagship phones,\nand it just hasn't quite been able\nto match that highest level.\nI'd say now it's on the\nacceptable for a flagship level,\nbut it's not quite beating those yet,\nand that's still true about this phone.\nNow, this main sensor,\nit is actually very slightly different.\nInstead of the OnePlus\nOpens's Sony LYT-T808 sensor\nis the LYT-808 sensor.\nIt's two more megapixels,\nit's slightly wider aperture\nwith the glass in front of it.\nNevertheless, basically,\nthese OnePlus 12 photos\naren't going to shock you.\nI've done some side by side comparisons.\nI've even said this before,\nit's pretty good most of the time.\nIt's pretty sharp.\nIt's a little contrastier\nthan the OnePlus Open.\nThe HDR effect looks fine.\nIt just falls apart a little too quickly\nas soon as there's adverse\nconditions, especially low light.\nBut here's the thing,\njust for the context of\nthat it's not that far behind,\nwe've already tested this,\nbecause we did the blind\nsmartphone camera test last year\nwith 20 of the best smartphone\ncameras in the world,\nand in that test was the OnePlus Open.\nSo yeah, there's a lot\nof software involved\nwith these cameras, but basically,\nthis extremely similar camera system,\nin the standard light photo,\nit had the third highest ELO\nrating behind the two pixels.\nThen in portrait mode, it was also top 10.\nBut in low light, it was\nfifth from the bottom,\nright around the Sony and below the Razr.\nSo in summary, yeah, the\ncamera system is new,\nit does have new hardware, it\nhas a new zoom and everything,\nbut all together, it is just like\na lot of the other stuff I'm showing you,\na little bit better than last year.\nAnd that's gonna be good\nenough for a lot of people.\nActually, most people most of the time.\nBut if we wanna consider\nit flagship, it's just,\nthere is a little bit of a\ngap till it reaches the best.\nBut I'll tell you what, they\neven more keep stacking it up.\nThere are so many little\nthings about using\nthis OnePlus phone that I really like.\nLike, I love that I can\nspecifically force any app I want\nto be at whatever frame rate I want.\nLike, there's literally a\nlist of every single app\non my phone, and by default,\nyou've probably noticed,\nall of the mapping apps,\nlike Waze and Google Maps,\nthey always, even on every\nother 120 hertz phone,\nthey always override and run at 60 hertz.\nBut on this phone, I can just fix it.\nJust give me all of the frames, please.\nI also love that this phone\nhas an infrared blaster.\nOne of the least common\nfeatures in the world\nof a modern smartphone alongside,\nlike, a headphone jack.\nBut yeah, it literally\nlets you turn on and off\nand control appliances remotely\nwithout having to find the\nremote, like this TV here,\nor a stranger's TV, I don't know.\nIt's the little things.\nI love that this USB-C port\nnot only supports basically\nthe fastest charging we've\never seen on a phone in the US,\nbut also supports extremely\nfast data transfer speeds.\nThis is a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port.\nThe names and generations\nare horrible at this point\nand incredibly confusing.\nAll you really need to know\nis that this has basically\nthe best data speeds\navailable from a USB-C phone.\nSo if you get the right cable,\nyou can get large files, like videos,\non and off of the device real quick.\nAnd then a lot of you will probably love\nthat this new screen\nsupports high PWM dimming.\nIf you've never heard of this before,\nit might not even matter to you,\nbut there is a select\nfraction of the population\nthat is specifically\nsensitive to the flickering\nthat becomes visible\nat super low brightness\nwith a lot of these\nsmartphone OLED displays,\nto the point where,\nlike, it causes headaches\nand eye fatigue.\nSo, some smartphones, including this one,\nare now addressing it with\nsuper high pulse-width modulation.\nBasically, they still flicker on and off\nto get that lower perceived brightness,\nbut much, much faster than\nthe human eye can perceive,\n2,160 hertz in this phone's case.\nSo, it still appears liquid smooth\nat all brightness\nlevels, which is awesome.\nIf you use your phone in\nthe rain or when it's wet,\nyou probably already know\nhow chaotic that feels.\nLike, there's memes about it.\nLike, it just seems to\nkind of act on its own\nwhen there's water droplets on the screen.\nBut this phone claims that\nwith a new technology called Aqua Touch,\nit will totally remain as usable as ever,\neven with water all over the screen.\nNow, you might have seen the ads for it.\nIt might sound ridiculous,\nbut it actually works.\nIt's not perfect, obviously,\nbut you can definitely feel\nthat it's dramatically more responsive,\nto the point where I\ncan actually type things\non this wet phone screen,\nwhere I just would not\nwanna do that on any\nother phone without this.\nKind of feels like magic.\nI am very impressed.\nAnd then there's even just\nextra little tiny things\non top of that, like 12\nor 16 gigs of fast RAM.\nThat's sick. Future-proof.\nAlso, Dolby Atmos with\nspatial audio support. Great.\nIt also has great haptics.\nLike, all this tiny stuff adds up\nto be a great overall experience.\nBut it's not perfect, right?\nLet's be real. No phone is perfect.\nBut at least I can say about this phone\nthat also the downsides are\nalso a couple small things.\nLike, I, for one, I've\nalready talked about this,\nbut I'm kind of over the curved displays,\nso, this one keeping that,\nit's not a deal breaker,\nlike, you might even argue\nit's a little more character\nto this phone in the\nworld of 2024 smartphones,\nbut it definitely has its downsides.\nfrom the glare to the light fall off\nto the drop test durability.\nBut okay, fine, they've gone curved.\nBut then the fingerprint sensor underneath\nis also still a pretty\naverage optical sensor.\nDoesn't feel like it's\nbeen upgraded in years.\nAnd then for having the new\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip inside,\nwhich a lot of other flagships do,\nthis phone doesn't really have\nany of the AI features, like, at all,\nand this is something I\nwanted to keep an eye on\nwith all these phones coming out\nwith this chip early in\nthis year, which is, okay,\nQualcomm puts out a new chip,\nsmall performance gains,\nsmall efficiency gains, but\nalso huge new AI capabilities,\nand this phone kind of\njust skipped the AI part.\nNow, not that that's a disaster,\nbut those were some\ngenuinely useful features.\nThe only one I found on this\nphone is in the photo editor,\nand it's called AI Palettes,\nbut it's just like a color overlay.\nI don't even really think there's\nthat much AI going on with this at all.\nSo, none of that generative\nfill, crop correction,\nnone of that Magic Editor stuff,\nnone of that auto live\ntranscription of phone calls\nor live translation of phone calls,\nnone of that, like, speaker\nlabels in the voice app,\nnone of the auto summaries in the browser\nor anything like that, just none of it.\nIt's not on this phone.\nAnd then also, random bug.\nI don't know, but every time\nI'm in the overlay browser\nand I reach up to my\nfavorite little alert slider\non the OnePlus phone and change modes,\nit opens a search box,\nlike, to find in page.\nI don't know why, they\nshouldn't be connected,\nbut it does it every single time.\nBut maybe the biggest legitimate\ndownside of this phone\nwhen you're comparing it\nto the other flagships\nit's going up against is it's promised\nfewer years of software update support.\nNow, I've already gotten a\npretty major software update\nsince I started testing this phone,\nbig camera improvements and bug fixes,\nstuff like that, great,\nbut they are only\npromising, only promising,\nfour years of software updates\nand five years of security updates.\nNow, that's fine, a lot of\npeople will only plan on\nkeeping this phone for\nthree or four years,\nmaybe five years before\nmoving on to the next one,\nbut in the world of the\nflagships, the Pixels,\nthe Samsungs of the\nworld, even the iPhones\ngiving you six or seven\nyears of software updates,\nthis is just notably behind on that.\nAnd maybe OnePlus didn't\nthink it was worth\nthe extra resources,\nit doesn't think people\ncare that much about it\nto actually spend money on\nit to put the resources in,\nbut yeah, four or five versus seven.\nSo, is this a flagship killer?\nWell, that just depends on your\ndefinition of a flagship, doesn't it?\nI think this is probably\nthe most compelling thing\nabout this phone, is going to be\nhow competitively priced it is,\nbecause it's very similar\nin a lot of ways to,\nlet's call it S24 Ultra, right?\nBut I've seen this phone,\nthe 16 gigs of RAM,\nhalf terabyte version,\nfor 899 on their site.\nBut if you pre-order it,\nyou can get that for 799.\nBut they're also advertising\nit in a lot of places for 699,\nbecause they're apparently\njust giving you 100 bucks\nfor a trade-in of any\nphone, in any condition.\nSo, if you're going with 699\nand this phone starts at 1,300 bucks,\nthen yeah, that is a damn good deal.\nSo yeah, I'd just be looking\nat what's important to you.\nI would say if camera is\nreally important to you,\nor if long-term software support\nis actually super high on your list,\nor if any of those AI features\nlooked really compelling\nor really interesting\nthat you'd want them,\nthen you'd probably end up going with\none of those other flagships.\nBut for everything else,\nlike, for performance,\nfor a great screen,\nfor incredible battery,\nsuper fast charging, ultra smooth,\nlike, this phone is better\nthan you probably think.\nOh, and on top of all that, OnePlus also\naround the same time has\nreleased this phone right here.\nIt looks almost the same,\nbut this is the OnePlus 12R.\nAnd this is just a a\nbudgetedized, budgetized?\nA budget version even more\nso than this phone already,\njust basically cutting a few corners.\nA few corners on the camera, right?\nIt's a Snapdragon 8 Gen\n2 instead of the Gen 3.\nThere's no wireless\ncharging, things like that.\nIt's IP64 instead of IP65, whatever.\nIt's a slightly trimmed down version.\nAgain, 500 bucks. I'm just saying.\nSo, if these phones weren't\nalready on your radar,\nthey probably should be.\nThanks for watching, catch\nyou guys in the next one.\nPeace.\n(smooth music)",

    "transcript": "[music playing]\nHi, I’m Philip Resnik,\nfrom the University of Maryland.\nBefore we get started, I want to note\nthat some of the things\nwe will be talking about\nin this talk can be challenging.\nAnd if you, or somebody that you care\nabout is having difficulty,\nfeeling hopeless,\nfeeling in a crisis,\nthere are resources\nthat you can reach out\nto and some of them\nare on this slide.\nSo to start with, I want to situate\nmental health\nwithin the broader\ncontext of healthcare.\nOne thing that a lot of people\ndon’t realize is that mental health\nis every bit as much of a problem\nas pretty much anything else\nwe face in healthcare.\nIn surely, economic terms\nmental illness,\nin terms of its global worldwide\ncost,\nis right up there\nwith cardiovascular diseases\nand it’s more than diabetes\nand chronic respiratory diseases\nand cancer combined.\nWhat makes it worse in the US\nis that even if you are somebody\nwho knows you are having a problem\nand you want to get help,\na third of the population\nin the United States lives in an area\nthat’s been federally designated\nas not having enough mental-health\ncare providers.\nSuicide, in 2016, became the second\nleading cause of death\nfor young people in the US\nbetween the ages of 10 and 34.\nAnd in fact, in the US,\nsuicide is quite a lot more\nprevalent than homicide.\nIf you think about the problems\nthat clinicians face,\none way to look at it is as\na sequence of things that happens.\nYou have what I will call screening,\nwhich is trying to identify\nthat somebody has a problem\nthat needs\nto be dealt with in the first place.\nSecond is assessment, trying\nto figure out what the problem is,\nhow severe it is.\nThen you have intervention,\ntreatment and finally,\nwhen somebody is in treatment\nor therapy of some kind,\nyou have monitoring in order\nto keep track of their condition\nand see if they’re still okay, see if\nthey’re going downhill and so forth.\nNow these are really hard problems\neven for clinicians,\na small subset\nof the problems they face.\nOne is that a lot of the interaction\nthey have takes the form\nof a structured interview,\nand when you are doing that,\nyou are drawing on your training\nand that may involve very different\ntheories or underlying paradigms.\nThere is not necessarily a standard\napproach to every problem.\nSecond, clinicians are often\ngoing on instinct,\nnot just the data or aspects\nof the clinical training.\nAnd so this introduces\npotentially the risk of bias.\nFor example, when a clinician\nmight be dealing with somebody\nwho is not from\ntheir own socio-economic group\nor racial category,\nor from some other community\nthat they’re less familiar with.\nAnd this really comes out\nwhen clinicians have to deal\nwith people from a specialized\npopulation of some kind.\nMany clinicians don’t have\nthe specialized training\nto deal with,\nfor example, military veterans,\nor people with drug addictions\nand so forth.\nOne of the biggest problems\nthat clinicians have is\nthat they have a limited window into\nwhat’s going on with the patient.\nThey have these clinical visits,\nand if you think about it,\na typical psychiatric visit,\nthese are perhaps regular,\nperhaps few or far between.\nAnd you’ve got often 15 minutes\nthat are devoted primarily\nto managing somebody’s medications.\nThere’s an enormous amount\nof the lived experience\nof a patient that clinicians\nsimply have no access to.\nAnd the problems are more\ncomplicated today\nin the shadow\nof the Covid-19 pandemic.\nClinicians have expressed concerns\nabout a mental-health tsunami,\nabout an eco-pandemic that’s coming\nabout as a result of things\nlike social isolation\nand financial burden and stress.\nNow there is an enormous amount\nof potential for technology to help.\nFranklin and colleagues\ndid a meta-analysis,\nwhere they looked at the research\non suicidal thoughts and behaviors\nusing traditional methods\nfor studying the problem\nand trying to understand\nwhat factors put people at risk.\nAnd what they discovered\nis that the ability\nto predict suicidal thoughts\nand behaviors\nhas not improved over the space\nof 50 years of research.\nLooking at their data,\nthey came to the conclusion\nthat the current state of things\nsuggested a shift\nfrom the traditional\nrisk factor-based methods\nto taking a data-driven machine-\nlearning approach to the problem.\nSo one way of looking at this\nis thinking about suicide\nas a binary prediction problem.\nOne would like to separate users\nwho will go onto make\nan attempt from users who don’t.\nAnd by users, by the way,\nI am foreshadowing the idea\nthat we’re going to be looking at\nfor example social media evidence\nas opposed to simply things\nin a clinical setting.\nA very nice paper on this topic\nis written by Glen Coppersmith\nand colleagues in 2018.\nAt the left here, you see\na performance curve, an ROC curve,\nfor a bunch of predictive models\nthat they developed on predicting\na suicide attempt or not,\na binary classification problem,\nfrom somebody’s\nsocial media evidence.\nThe diagonal line is Chance\nPerformance and Perfect\nis up into the left,\nand you can see, you’re getting some\npretty strong performance here.\nIn fact, in their analysis\nthey looked at\na theoretical population\nof a thousand individuals.\nThey extrapolated their results\ninto the statistics\nof a real-world setting\nwhere you had a typical\nprevalence of peoples’\nlikelihood of making\na suicide attempt.\n40 – 60% of the people that the model\npredicted would go on\nto make a suicide attempt did.\nIn contrast, if you look at\nthe typical performance of clinicians\ntrying to make the same prediction,\na typical clinician,\nin their judgments, 4 –\n6% of the people that they predict\nwill go onto a suicide attempt\nactually go on to do so.\nAnd so the message here is clear,\nthese machine-learning models\nactually may not be perfect,\nbut they have an enormous amount\nof valuable possibility,\npotential information in them.\nAnd it’s not just the binary\nclassification problem,\nit’s also about understanding\nwhat’s going on with people\nand characterizing that in ways\nthat clinicians can understand.\nSo here, for example, is an essay\nwritten by a college student\nabout coming to college.\nAnd a typical machine-learning\napproach\nwill identify useful features\nfor say,\na binary classification problem.\nI’ve put them in bold here.\nBut you can also take a more\nnuanced approach, colleagues\nand I used a kind of technology\ncalled a Topic Model\nin order to automatically,\nin an unsupervised way\nfor the language,\nbut then with some supervision\nrelated to personality.\nWe'll get to that in a second.\nWe used these techniques\nto in some sense,\nevoke or discover themes\nin the language\nthat people were using\nin these college essays.\nSo for example, in blue here\nyou see language\nthat’s related to social isolation,\n‘I don’t want to go to class\nor leave my room or talk to people.’\nThe things in red are related\nto vegetative symptoms,\nthat is energy level.\nThe things in green are related\nto anhedonia,\nthat is being unable to enjoy things\nthat you used to enjoy.\nIn an analysis that we did,\nwe looked at a large set\nof these kinds of essays\nand looked at the kinds of themes,\nwhich you can kind of think of\nas very much like word clusters,\nthat came out of this.\nSo you have one row per topic\nor theme that was discovered.\nAnd we looked at these using a model\nthat related\na person’s language\nto their score for neuroticism\non a standard personality\ninventory.\nAnd what we found was, for example,\nthat in the themes or topics\nthat were not associated\nwith neuroticism\nyou tended to find things\nlike going to sports,\nlistening to music,\ngoing to parties,\nthings that are indicative\nof social engagement\nof people in this population.\nIn things that were more positively\nassociated with neuroticism,\nwhich is by the way,\noften co-morbid with depression,\nand that was the context of this,\ntrying to find things that might be\nrelevant for looking at depression,\nyou have those energy-related\nthings like sleep and getting tired.\nBut you also see this being expressed\nthrough\nwhat was automatically\ndiscovered in the data in ways\nthat are specific\nto the college population.\nRight?\nI mean you wouldn’t expect\nthat other populations\nwould necessarily express\na lack of energy level\nin terms of things\nlike being late for class\nor falling asleep in class\nor taking naps.\nBut that’s what you see\nin a college population.\nThe same kinds of techniques\ncan be applied to other populations\nin order to look at things\nthat are more specific to them.\nAnd of course, a similar thing\ngoes on here\nwhere you see a topic showing up\nthat’s about anxiety,\nstress, nervousness.\nAnd not surprising for this\npopulation you seen things like tests\nand studying and feeling anxious,\nand having a hard time focusing.\nNow, what I’ve said so far is\nthat there are some\nreal opportunities for progress\nbecause there is useful signal\nin peoples’ language.\nBut progress depends on actually\nhaving the data to work with,\nand that can be a real challenge.\nIn a clinical setting, HIPAA\nand privacy considerations\ncan make it very difficult\nto actually get relevant data\nrelated to mental-health\nand healthcare in general.\nIn addition, that data alone\ndoesn’t give you much more than\na limited window into\nwhat’s going on in peoples’ lives.\nSo I’m going to use a term\nthat Coppersmith introduced,\n‘The Clinical Whitespace’,\nin order to describe\nother kinds of data\nthat are available to us,\nthat didn’t used to be\navailable to us.\nWhat computational social\nscientists sometimes call\n‘The Digital Traces\nof People’s Lived Experiences’.\nWhat you have here at the top\nin the little red lines\nare one individual’s\nhealthcare interactions,\nfive of them over\nthe course of a year.\nThe blue lines are their social media\nposts over the same time period.\nSo you can see the term ‘Clinical\nWhite Space’ is really evocative.\nYou literally have the white space\nbetween the healthcare encounters,\nwhere there’s an enormous\namount of information.\nAnd it’s social media\nso it’s information in the form\nof language to a great extent,\nand that’s incredibly\nuseful information\nto have in a mental-health setting.\nNow of course, there are privacy\nissues, ethical issues,\ntechnical issues\nin being able to obtain\nand work with those kinds of data.\nWhat Coppersmith and colleagues\nhave done\nis set up a data\ndonation platform called\n‘Our.Data.Helps.Org’,\nand that is a platform\nthat enables anybody to go\nand donate their data for research,\nprimarily people who have survived\na suicide attempt\nand want to donate their data\nto help others.\nYou can also have people who have\nloved ones who have died by suicide,\ndonating the data of the loved ones.\nYou can also have people who have\nnever had a connection\nwith suicide\ndonating their data anyway,\nbecause of course you need people\nacross all ranges\nof the mental-health spectrum\nin order to do machine learning\nand better understand\nwhat’s going on.\nWe at The University of Maryland,\nhave taken that a step further,\ncollaborating with Coppersmith\nand his organization,\nthey have OurDataHelps.org.\nIn collaboration with them\nwe’ve created UMD.OurDataHelps.org.\nAnd in collaboration\nwith Deanna Kelly,\nat University of Maryland’s\nmedical school, and Carol S.\nB.\nWilson, and John Dickerson,\nat University of Maryland\nCollege Park where I am,\nwe have a project going on where we\nare doing a similar kind of ethical,\ncareful,\nconsented data collection\nfor people who may be suffering\nfrom schizophrenia and depression.\nSo there are frameworks that make\nit possible to collect data\nin an ethical, appropriate way\nin order to do this kind of work.\nNow how do we make progress\nwithin natural language\nprocessing and AI more generally?\nSomething that I think has been\nborne out literally over decades\nis that the way\nyou make progress\nis by getting an entire community\nof people in the research field\nto collaborate on the same problems\non the same datasets.\nAnd this falls within a category\nthat sometimes is referred to\nas a shared task.\nYou have some dataset,\norganizers of an activity,\na shared task activity,\nmake it available,\ndefine the specifics of the problem\nthat one might be trying to solve.\nFor example, it might be predicting\nthe depression\nrating of an individual\nor predicting suicide attempts\nor predicting a level\nof suicide risk.\nIn typical cases these are\npredictive modeling problems\nwhere you use supervised learning\nin order to train on a dataset\nthat has the correct or ground\ntruth answers for individuals,\nand then you test on a held out,\nor previously unseen dataset\nof individuals and evaluate.\nSo that’s what you see here,\nyou identify a dataset\nthat people are going to use\nin common, you define the task,\nyou get a bunch of teams\nto participate,\nusing different kinds of approaches.\nYou get the data out to them,\nyou then get test data out to them\nto evaluate on, you evaluate\nand see how they did\nand then you have a conversation,\nyou have a workshop, a conference,\ngetting people together to talk\nabout what worked well,\nwhat worked not well\nand what you should do next.\nNow you may notice something here,\nthis idea of distributing data\nis a real problem.\nFrom a privacy point of view,\nthis is one of the enormous\nproblems in healthcare in general\nand certainly in mental health\nas well,\neven with social media data,\nwhich can be quite sensitive.\nSimply getting data out\nto the research community\nis something that makes\na lot of people nervous\nand possibly justifiably so\nbecause it introduces risk.\nSo how do we solve that problem?\nThat’s a problem that’s really\nbeen holding the field back.\nWell, one approach that has\nrecently been explored\nis the idea\nof a secure data enclave.\nA number of people have been\nexploring variations on this theme.\nIn collaboration with folks at NORC\nat the University of Chicago,\nthat’s a non-profit\nresearch organization,\nI have been working to help them\ndevelop a secure data enclave\nwhere the idea is you bring\nthe researchers to the data,\nrather than vice versa.\nThere is a secure environment\nwhere the data live,\nand the researchers come there,\nand the data can’t get out.\nSo we’ve actually been in the process\nof doing that\nfor a shared task specifically\nfocused on prediction of suicide\nrisk as a part\nof a workshop called\n‘The Workshop on Computational\nLinguistics and Clinical Psychology’\nthat is a part of\nThe North American Association\nfor Computational Linguistics\nConference in 2021.\nThe way that this enclave works\nis teams\ncan go to a log-in page\nwith secure log-in credentials,\ncome into the enclave\nto a secure desktop,\na virtual desktop\nthat doesn’t let data out.\nIn fact it doesn’t even let them\ncopy and paste\nfrom inside\nand outside the desktop.\nAnd from there, they can then go\nto an AWS-backed environmental\nwhere they have the full arsenal\nof natural language\nprocessing\nand machine-learning tools\nand can work on the data\nin this secure environment\nin order to develop predictive models\nand improve the algorithms\nand do formative assessment\nof how they’re doing.\nAnd to do summative assessment\nby taking that test data\nthey’ve never seen before\nand evaluating\nand seeing how their system does.\nAnd then finally, at the upper right,\nyou have the ability to take things\nlike results off of the enclave,\nbut that goes through a careful\nprocess of review and governance\nto make sure nothing is leaving\nthe enclave that shouldn’t.\nThat little x is showing you that\nthis entire process\nis disconnected\nfrom the internet at large,\nexcept through carefully\ngoverned processes.\nAnd so we actually just completed\na shared task\nlooking at level of risk assessment\nfor a dataset of individuals\nwho had posted on social media.\nAnd I’m not going to go\nthrough the numbers here.\nThe take-home message\nis we have teams, we have numbers,\nwe have improvements over the baseline\nperformance that took place\nbecause people were able to do\nthis work and improve the approaches.\nAnd we’re having a workshop\nto discuss it\nand then hopefully to figure out\nwhat we’ve learnt\nand move the field forward.\nSo let’s suppose we’re wildly\nsuccessful.\nSuppose we have great data\nand suppose\nthis gives us great classifiers,\ngreat predictions in the case\nof mental-health conditions,\nsuicide attempts and so forth.\nThere’s a question that we\nas technologists often don’t ask,\nwhich is ‘Then what?’\nWe think about a particular\nabstraction of the problem.\nWe’re taking a bunch of data,\nwe have a prediction task,\nwe apply our techniques, we obtain\npredictions, we evaluate them.\nBut of course all of this takes place\nwithin a broader\nmental-health eco-system.\nIf one were going to actually use\nthis for something useful,\nand I need to remind you\nthat a little while ago\nwe talked about the fact\nthat the mental-healthcare system\nis already overburdened\nand under-resourced.\nWhat happens in a country,\nin the US for example,\nwhere you have\na third of the population\nwho would have a hard time\nseeing a mental-health provider\neven if they knew they had a problem.\nWhat happens when we start\ngetting better at identifying\nthat somebody might need\nto be seen,\nwhat happens when we increase\nthe number of true positives?\nAnd of course, also add false\npositives to that as well.\nThis suggests a shift,\nthere are really two shifts.\nOne that I’m not going into here\nis a shift from viewing\nthis as a technological problem\nto viewing it as a societal problem.\nOne of the best ways\nto solve the problem\nwith under-resourced\nmental-healthcare\nis to provide more resources\nfor mental-healthcare.\nBut as technologists we also\ncan make progress.\nAnd one of the ways that I want\nto suggest we can make progress\nis by a shift from thinking\nabout mental-health in general\nand this problem of predicting\nwhether somebody may be\nat risk for suicide.\nGoing from thinking of it\nas a classification problem,\na yes or no,\nto thinking of it as a kind\nof a prioritization problem.\nYou have a population of individuals\nand the traditional technology-\ncentric use of the problem,\nwhich have been taken in a variety\nof shared tasks at that CL\nSite workshop,\nat the Clay E-Risk workshops\nand other forms\nwhere people work on this.\nThat view tends to say\nit’s a labeling problem yes or no?\nOr maybe it’s a stratified,\nmultiple label,\nsevere, moderate, low-risk,\nno-risk and so forth.\nBut that may not be enough,\nit doesn’t take into account\nthe realities of the world\nthat the clinicians live in.\nSo let’s abstract what that world\nlooks for a second.\nThink about somebody I will\ndescribe as an expert,\nsomebody somewhere in the set\nof clinicians who evaluate people.\nThey have a population of individuals\nwho might potentially be at risk.\nSo this is the monitoring piece\nfrom that earlier slide.\nI’m not talking about\nscreening everybody;\nI’m talking about let’s start\nby looking at the problem\nwith a population of people that\nyou already know might be at risk.\nIn that population, somehow you need\nto prioritize limited resources\nsuch as the clinician's time.\nAnd if you have evidence coming\nfrom the kinds of techniques\nthat I’ve been talking about,\nyou may have, say,\nlots of social media posts.\nA clinician can’t look at everything\nto help decide how much attention\nand when this particular patient\nis going to need.\nSo you also have a nested\nprioritization problem,\nwhere you have to decide\nwhat is most likely the thing\nthe clinician should look at\nin order to figure out\nwhat’s going on with the patient.\nAnd of course, all of this has to be\ndone within limited resources,\nand particularly the time\nof the humans in this loop.\nWith student Hon Chang Ching\nand my colleague, Doug Ord,\nwe’ve developed\na technical approach to this,\nit takes advantage of something\nfrom deep learning\ncalled The Three Level,\nHierarchical Attention Network.\nAnd the interesting thing about this\nparticular deep-learning approach\nis that you may have a situation\nwhere you have a single label\nfor an individual\nand also evidence from say\nmultiple documents,\nand within that document\nmultiple sentences say.\nAnd you don’t have individual\ndocuments\nlabeled like you often do\nin natural language processing,\nsupervised learning problems,\nit’s just the individual.\nThis is an architecture\nthat allows you to have\njust the label\nof the individual at the top\nand to use what you learn\nin training to help decide\nwhich of the documents\nwere most responsible\nfor the label\nthat was predicted,\nand which of the sentences\nwithin the documents\nand words within the sentences\nwere most responsible\nfor what’s being predicted.\nAnd this enables you to produce\nresults at run time,\nat test time, if you will,\nwhere you can take a population\nof previously unseen\nindividuals, rank them.\nHere we’ve got the individuals\nbeing ranked,\nand then for each individual\nin a nested way, rank their documents\nand here you also have a heat map\nover the individual words\nthat might be responsible.\nWhat you’re seeing here\nare actual results,\nobfuscated for privacy reasons,\nbut actual results of the top\nthree individuals\nin some experimentation that we did.\nAnd within the individuals\nyou see the documents.\nAnd then you see the heat map\nover the words that were most\nimportant in making the prediction\nthat produced the ranking,\nthat this was one, two and three,\nin terms of suicide risk.\nOnce you do that you can quantify\nhow well it is that your system\nis doing by imagining\nand in fact simulating a scenario\nwhere you have a clinician\nwith limited time.\nAnd simulating, estimating\nthe amount of time things take,\nand then finally saying\nfor a given time budget\nhow many individuals who actually\nare at risk, the positive instances,\nwould they have found\nwithin that time budget.\nAnd so here’s a result\nfrom Han’s paper.\nThe thing that I want to point\nto here is the middle column,\nwhere we simulated\na time budget of three hours,\nand the numbers here\nare the number of individuals\nseverely at risk in our population,\nin our dataset,\nof which there were 44\nseverely at risk in total.\nHow many of them would have been\nfound by the clinician\nwithin a three-hour time budget\nusing different ways\nof processing documents\nand assigning rankings of individuals\nand rankings of documents.\nAnd what you can see here\nis that number at the bottom\nof the middle column\nis significantly higher than, say,\nthe baselines we have up\nat the top of the column.\nIf you use some of the more naïve\napproaches\nlike user-logistic regression\nand rank individuals using that,\nand then just look at their documents\nin reverse chronological order\nor forward chronological order,\nyou can see that using a more\nsophisticated architecture\nyou can improve\non the number of individuals\nthat could have been found\non average,\nwithin that specific time budget.\nNow there’s another interesting\napproach to prioritization,\nthat colleagues\nand I have been working with.\nThere is a colleague of mine\nnamed John Dickerson\nat The University of Maryland,\nand this comes about because\nI went to a talk that he gave.\nIt had nothing to do\nwith mental health.\nHe was using a machine-learning\napproach called Multi-Armed Bandits,\nand a particular development of that\nthat he and students had done called\nTiered Multi-Armed Bandits,\nsort of a hierarchy\nof Multi-Armed Bandits.\nAnd they were applying this\nto the problem\nof deciding who should get a job.\nAnd the idea here is that each stage\nor tier of their framework\nyou have successively more\ncostly ways of gathering information\nthat also are successively\nor progressively more informative.\nSo at Stage 1, maybe you do\nsomething like reviewing a resume,\nwhich is relatively inexpensive.\nSome subset of the population then\npasses through to the next stage,\nand maybe you do a remote interview,\nand then that’s more\nexpensive of course.\nYou only want another subset\nof those to pass onto say\nthe most expensive stage\nwhere they might do an onsite visit.\nAnd from that you then say,\n‘Okay, this is the subset\nthat I’m going to hire.’\nAnd I actually went to this talk\non this topic,\nand I said ‘John’,\nand I grabbed him by the arm.\nThis is actually quite literally\ngrabbed him by the arm\nand dragged him off to coffee,\nand I said\n‘You actually are solving my problem.\nYou have a hammer,\nand the problem that I’m focused\non looks a lot like a nail.’\nAnd so we’ve now been collaborating\non a framework\nwhere you take exactly\nthis same kind of approach\nbut in a mental-health setting,\nwhere the goal\nis to take a population\nand have them go through\nsuccessively more costly\nbut also more informative assessments\nin order to decide\nat the end of the process\nwhich subset of those are the highest\npriority for clinical attention.\nSo you could imagine\nthat at the first stage you do\nthe kinds of predictive modelling\nthat I was just talking about.\nAt the second stage, perhaps,\nit’s more costly\nin an individual’s\ntime and intrusiveness,\nbut maybe you get them to interact\nonline with an avatar\nor do a survey or do\nother information-gathering steps\nto get an idea\nof what’s going on with them,\nwithout a human clinician\nin the loop.\nMaybe some subset of those\ngets passed on for review,\nto have somebody who is not\nthe end-state clinician\nbut somebody in the middle,\nreview these things and say\n‘Okay, this is the evidence\nI’ve got, these are the ones\nwho need the most\nimmediate attention’ and so forth.\nNow I need to emphasize that\nwithin this kind of setting\nwe are envisioning\ndoing this with people\nwho are already being cared of.\nAnd therefore, at any step in the\nprocess you still have the ability,\nin fact the need,\nto receive conventional care\non conventional schedules.\nThat’s the line\nthat you have across the top here,\nso people are still seeing\ntheir clinicians\nin a regularly scheduled way.\nThey’re still going ahead and able\nto call them\nwhen they need them and so forth.\nThe idea here is that this is a way\nof utilizing limited resources\nin order to add information that\nmight not have been available before\nin order to improve what’s going on\nwith that patient in-between\nwhen they are calling their doctor,\nor in-between their regular\nclinical visits and so forth.\nSo this is an approach\nthat is underway\nand something we’re going to be\ncontinuing to develop in the future,\ninformed by this scenario, this idea\nof a prioritization framework.\nSo let me leave you with a couple\nof take aways.\nTakeaway number 1 is that\nmental healthcare is healthcare,\nit is an enormous problem\nright up there.\nPeople often don’t think about it\nalong with the huge problems\nthat we face\nin the healthcare system,\nthings like cancer and chronic\ndiseases,\ncardiovascular diseases,\nall the rest of that.\nBut mental healthcare is right up\nthere with those by any way\nof measuring things, whether you’re\ntalking about the economic costs,\nwhether you’re talking about\nthe human cost.\nA second takeaway is that language\ncontains really valuable signal.\nLanguage\nin the clinical records,\nyes, I haven’t talked much\nabout that here in this talk.\nBut also language that people\nuse in their everyday life\nto which we have greater\nand greater access,\nthanks to the ability to look at\nwhat they’re saying on social media.\nAnd here along with this takeaway\nI have to emphasize\nthat there are deep, ethical issues\nthat need to be grappled with\nin order to figure out\nappropriate ways to improve things.\nAnd this is something that there’s\nan entire sub-community\nemerging on that is involved\nin ethical considerations\nand discussions like that.\nThird, I want to emphasize\nthat we need prioritization.\nNot just binary classification tasks,\nwe need to be thinking about\nthe then what question.\nWhat is it that happens\nwhen technology enters\nthe broader mental-health eco-system,\nwhat impact is that going to have?\nAnd given the severe\nresource limitations\nthat we are likely to continue\nseeing onward into the future,\nthis creates a set\nof computational problems\nthat can be viewed as resource\nallocation and optimization\nand constrained optimization\nproblems of various kinds.\nAnd finally, in terms of using\ndata ethically\nand making progress\nso that more people are okay\nwith sharing their data\nand more organizations\nare okay with researchers\nusing data for purposes of this kind,\nI want to leave you with\nthe suggestion that data enclaves\nare a potentially really useful,\ninteresting way to enable\nthat kind of work to go on\nwhile keeping the data privacy issues\nand all of the other ethical\nissues of governance\nand so forth very firmly in mind.\nI would like to thank my\ncollaborators over quite a few years.\nI would like to thank a variety of\nsources here for financial support,\nand I would like to thank you\nvery much for listening.",

    "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to today's video so\nlet me start today's video by sharing\nthe story of facebook/\nmetastock okay meta has gone up by 20%\nin a single day return I spoke about\nthis stock two years ago in fact I built\ncrazy positions in this stock 2 years\nago 2 years ago go back and check what\nwas happening in meta massive layoffs us\ncorrection Tech correction B\novervaluation meta will not survive this\nthat there was so much negative\ncommentary so much negative commentary\nnow please note that meta is a large cap\ncompany it is Blue Chip it is one of the\nbest tech companies in the world and my\nreturn on it was 50% cagr whatever money\nI had invested 2 years ago I keep\ngetting the question and now I'm getting\nthe\nquestion should we go and invest in meta\nstock now can we still make 50% cagr no\nit will not happen it is extremely\nextremely unlikely that you will see\nmore than 15 odd per compounding on a\nstock like ma because it is fairly large\ngap then comes the natural response\nright I mean we also want to make like\n30% 40% 50% cagr on some of the stocks\nso what are the type of stocks you can\nbuy in the market right now so see\nhonestly I will tell you straight Point\nBlank that by investing in large cap\ncompanies right now when the market is\nalmost at an all-time high you are not\ngoing to make returns more than 12 15%\nwhy am I saying it am I giving you some\nbiased information the short answer is\nno and this is the math that you need to\nknow that number one the nifty50 returns\nover the last 20 years period cagr is 12\na half% small caps small cap midcap\ncategory then that return gets doubled\nso you end up making roughly 25 odd per\ncagr if you go to micro cap the returns\nare even higher so you can make up to\nmaybe like 40 odd per returns from micro\ncap investing so if you actually want to\nmake 40 50% returns in this type of a\nmarket then like it or not you will have\nto do micro cap investing now is this a\npush from my side that micro cap\ninvesting you have to invest money in\nmicro cap no I'm just simply making this\nvideo to help you understand better what\nmicro cap investing is how you can apply\na framework to identify good micro cap\nstocks how much money you should be\ninvesting I will pick relevant case\nstudies I will discuss examples please\nconsider those companies as an example\nfor example I will help you understand\nthe agre export business Market in India\nthat market is growing quite extensively\nit's an export oriented Market one of\nthe key companies I'm going to discuss\nit is a micro cap company it is called\nas HMA ago Industries limited so that is\nan example I will use I will also use\nexamples of multiple other stocks this\nis not a\nrecommendation please understand the\nframework apply this framework to a\nbunch of other stocks that you are\nconsidering in the micro cap category\nand accordingly you can decide whether\nto buy it or not buy it so St and point\nnumber one or question number one that\nwe will quickly discuss is that should\nyou even consider doing micro cap\ninvesting and in what type of Market\nshould you invest in micro cap because\nAB I am buying some of the micro caps I\ndiscuss all my strategic moves in my\nmember community in case you are a\nserious investor you want to improve\nyour investing skills we have created\nthis community it is India's largest\nliterally number one Community people\nhave been benefiting from it for the\nlast 1 and a half years and you can go\nand check the reviews in the description\nand comment box Bas in case you are\ninterested you can check more details so\nlet's kick start and the first key point\nthat you need to understand is the\ndefinition of micro cap the large cap\nsmall micro companies in this risk is\nalso high and potential returns are also\nvery high now as per standard definition\nmicro cap but companies that are less\nthan market cap of 5,000 CR can be\ncategorized as micro cap companies so\nthen comes the most important\npart micro and why should you consider\nthe risk of investing in micro cap\ncompanies so okay so let us jump into\nthis chart this is a very important\nchart this blue line exhibits the\nreturns of micro cap this dark blue line\nexhibits the return of\n5500 right so yeah or nift 50 return\nright so this is these are the returns\nthis paragraph is very important because\nit allows you to understand the impact\nof returns so one rupe invested in Nifty\nmicro cap\n250\nIND micro it would now become\n14884 so 14x G I think this this should\nbe 1,000 not rupes 1 this is a mistake\nthat these news people have made now\ncompare this to Nifty small cap there\nthe returns are 12x if you go to nifty\n50 then returns are 11x and if you go to\nNifty 500 then returns are 10\nx% return and this is from the year 2016\nright so 2016 say roughly this data is\nfor 2023 right absolute differential in\nreturn was close to 50% so this is very\nvery high on how many years we 6 seven\nyears basis so additional s% per year\ngain is additional on micro cap\ninvesting so this is the reward part\nthat return if you go to micro cap\ninvesting now definitely this return\ndoes not come without its fair share of\nrisk and\nrisk for example take a look at this\nblue line and what you will notice is\nthat there was massive correction that\nwas happening in micro cap space even\nsmall cap medcap May and how much did\nmicro cap correct byy so this was\nroughly at 10K level and it fell to how\nmuch it fell to 3K level so there was\nalmost a 70% volatility SL draw down on\nmicro\ncap blue line so I will probably use a\ndifferent color so let me highlight\ngreen color so here a here right you can\nsee that here the Nifty was almost at\nwhat like 7,500 level it fell to how\nmuch like 3 and a 12,000 level right so\nso there was a 50% correction on large G\nbut almost 70 75% correction ction on\nmicro cap this is not an exception again\nif you go and check the data from here\nto here again you will see that this was\nat 4,000 and yeah\n1000 almost 75% correction so to cut the\nlong story short there are two Central\npoints number one if you want to make a\nkager of let's say 30% plus then you\nshould consider micro cap investing in\nwhat type of Market in a growth Market\nwhen there is Bull Run happening or you\nfeel that the Bull Run is going to last\nfor the next 2 3\nyears but if you unfortunately are wrong\nabout the bull run of the entire Market\nyou will see a massive draw down\ncorrection 70\n75% in Cas you haven't pressed the like\nbutton do press the like button so these\ntype of fundamental videos reach out to\nmore investors I know that you haven't\ndone it please do it it would allow and\nhelp these type of videos so anyways\ncoming to the Point see two things\nnumber one in a growth market for\nexample right now you're sitting in 2024\nand you're thinking you know what Boss\nNext 2 3 years are going to be very good\nXYZ government is going to win the\nelections and stock market\nus and right so by next year\n2025 one year Bull Run micro caps are\ngoing to give good rally this is logical\nthere is nothing off about this Theory\nbut if this Theory fails for some reason\nplease be prepared that there could be a\ndraw down this can easily fall if\nnifty50 corrects by 15 20% Then expect\nlike 40 45% correction on micro\ncap then please continue to watch the\nvideo otherwise just wind up please drop\noff I'm asking you to drop off because\nthis is dangerous stuff I do not want\nyou to get into all this I'm simply\nteaching this because this is something\nthat I'm applying to my portfolio right\nnow now in case you want to learn and\njust you know keep a track of it then\nplease continue to watch it please make\nnotes so okay so I hope that you\nunderstood the risk and reward of micro\ncap investing it is very rewarding but\nit comes with its own set of risks now\nwhat is the problem in terms of micro\ncap investing dangerous dangerous that\nis one part of it but the second key\npiece of information is that when big\ninvestors pick micro cap stocks rocket\nand by the time you are able to catch it\nit has already gone up like four five\ntimes so let me illustrate the case so\nShankar Sharma is one of the investors\nwho invest a lot of money in these type\nof Micro cap companies and I was\nwatching one of his inter views and he\nsaid that you know what I picked a\ncompany called as vant\nCommunications right and I will just\nquickly show it to you so he picked\nstake recently not very long ago and go\nand this is where the price of vant\ncommunication is right so it was at 24\nrupees right now it is at whatever like\nalmost 300 rupees by 10 12 times the\nstock has become now if you go and buy\nit here somewhere right I don't know\nwhether you'll be making any money on it\nor not but yes if you are able to bet on\nthe stock somewhere here in this range\nthen the opportunities to benefit from\nthese type of Investments are massive\nright so this is very common sensical\npoint that I'm saying that when it comes\nto normal retail investors like us we\nare not able to understand the\ninformation that's it\nsecond hardly anyone makes any videos\nright so today the case study that I'm\ngoing to cover in the last section that\nis not an IPO video the IPO of that\ncompany has happened a while back so I'm\njust doing an industry analysis and\nsharing the framework you can apply it\nfor any micro cap stock that you feel\nlike investing in now the second key\nproblem in terms of micro cap investing\nis that when we invest via the mutual\nfund route individual stocks pick I will\ngo and give my money to mutual fund\nsmall cap mutual funds and some of my\nmoney will get into micro caps and micro\ncap grow so I will get a lot of benefits\ngood theory but the there are two\nadditional problems with that number one\nthat here is the chart and you can take\na look at this you can see that the\ninvestment of small cap funds in micro\ncap is very low to begin with for\nexample DSP small cap and is the\nallocation to micro cap is 27% and this\nis very high and for example SBI small\ncap 10% allocation is there on micro cap\nso if you are betting on the theme of\nmicro caps then by going to small cap\nfunds it's very difficult for you to get\ntruly invested in the micro cap segment\nright so this is a problem a related\nproblem here is that when it comes to\nmicro cap investing example stock right\nit has gone like 12 13 14 15 times right\nnow booking some profit makes a lot of\nsense but mutual fund right I mean\nbooking profits in mutual fund is tough\nbecause you would not be able to track\nindividual stocks and figure out\novervalued\nright small cap overvalued midcap\novervalued this that so selling your\nstuff via mutual fund becomes a\nchallenge so therefore we need to learn\nabout micro cap investing so let me\nillustrate a case as to how you can go\nand actually analyze stock in the micro\ncap category so okay so you need to\nunderstand four specific points the\nfirst thing is that whether the industry\nis growing or not now if the industry\nitself is not growing by more than 5 6%\nthen\nmicro because if industry itself is not\ngrowing then how will that micro cap\ngrow second is that it should be very\nclear that you pick micro cap company X\nthen it should have some kind of mo mo\nmeans winning\nAdvantage it is a low cost producer it\nhas some kind of brand going for it it\ncan expand to different products it has\nsome geography Advantage XYZ country\nexport it has lot of\nrelationships then number three that\nthere should not be any red flags\nespecially promoter related red flags\nright this is very very\nimportant then why was the IPO brought\ninto the market for this company why\ncould the company just keep doing\nwhatever it was doing so all these\npoints are critical finally this is the\nmost important part that it should be\naligned with the fit of your portfolio\nfor example up large cap investor who\nthen there's no point in you going into\nmicro cap right similarly if you feel\nyou know what this is not a bull run\nphase markets are extremely overvalued I\ndon't see growth happening in the next\none 2 years CH though there is no point\nin going to micro cap category then you\nshould only invest in micro caps when\nyou feel that there is a bull run\nhappening or we are somewhere in the\nmiddle of Bull Run I do feel that we are\nsomewhere in the middle of Bull Run and\ntherefore I'm making this video so hypo\nmore importantly I spoke about the fact\nthat 70% draw down can happen in micro\ncaps not aat I use this framework I pick\nlike these five stocks all the five\nstocks are down by like 30% what can I\ndo please do not behave it that way\nplease understand the nature of micro\ncap investing and only then invest so\nlet me illustrate this entire framework\nin very simple Language by picking a\nlive example so let me just quickly go\nthrough it let me tell you how you can\ngo use Google to analyze all this data\nso AK discussion so number one if you\nlook at HMA Agro this is a micro cap\ncompany why because the market cap is\nless than 5,000 CR right and because\nunlike most of the micro caps\nsmall you will see that it ipoed at\nroughly 59 R right now it is at 7475\nR so therefore I picked it as a case\nstudy this is not a recommendation that\nyou buy sell this that I'm just simply\nsharing analysis framework that's it\nthat's how you need to see this so\nanyways coming back to topic what does\nHMA Agro industries does well it is into\nexport of products especially Frozen\nfresh buffalo meat and Frozen natural\nproducts like vegetabl cereals in India\nso this has to do with Agri export\ncategorization the company has a license\nfrom FSS or licensing requirement these\nare the licenses that these companies\nhave to take and FSS categorization of\nbusiness so this will fall in this\nparticular domain next\nframework part one and that at what rate\nis this industry growing and is India\npushing this industry or not right so if\nwe go and search this data so this is\nwhat you will find that dgci NS report\nthere was a growth of 13% right so this\nis very good healthy growth rate slow\ndown so that is also healthy growth rate\nfor an industry now within this segment\nhow much is India is a meat exporter to\nthe world so category India exports\nabout 43 % of world buffalo meat\nproduction so India already push and it\nis the number to export for India when\nit comes to Agricultural Product and\nbuffo meat now this is an export\noriented business almost 90% of the\nbusiness is from outside India to\ncountries like Malaysia Vietnam\nCambodia now comes a very natural\nquestion and this is a point where you\nneed to go and check for red flags which\nwas I think Point number three SL risks\non our framework now you need to start\nasking questions like these Vietnam\nMalaysia why not Europe why not us ET so\nthat's a very interesting point which\nyou need to again Google and figure\nout when it comes to us or Europe the\nexport standards are very very high they\nrequire high quality stuff A B they\nthemselves produce a lot of meat right\nso they do not really require it but on\nthe flip side countries like Vietnam\nQatar all these different different\ncountries where this particular company\nis exporting they are not meat producers\nthey are meat consumers so they actually\nneed to import from countries like India\nnow agricultural products for example\nmangoes Europe even Singapore now the\nhygiene standards are very very high how\nyou handle food is very very high now\nthey are very very prone to regulation\nnow because they are supplying to\ncountries like Vietnam\nCambodia one could argue that the\nhygiene standards are not as high in\nthese type of countries compared to us\nand Europe which are more regulation\nprone markets so this is actually a\nstrength of the company rather than\nbeing a limiting factor so then comes\nthe second part of the framework\ndiscover that simply means comparative\nadvantage now in the export world and if\nyou are from the export industry let me\nknow in the comment box whether you\nagree with this Viewpoint see if\nsomething is being exported out of China\nChina right it's very simple by because\nthe production cost in China is very low\nso there is price or cost advantage that\nChinese expor does\nhave so that is actually a good thing so\nhere if you go and Google and again read\nfrom their company reports you will find\na very interesting data point which I\nwas able to find so basically management\nthe price of meat that we export we are\nable to do it at a range of $2.8 to $3\nbut our competitors who are producing\nmeat they are able to export that same\nvery product at roughly between $5 to $6\nso there is cost or competitive\nadvantage that the company has on its\ncore product so I'm again stressing on\nthe word core product at least Advantage\nnow for a micro cap company growth is a\nkey level or key\nfactor right now they are exporting a\nlot of material when it comes to Buffalo\nfrozen meat but can they go into other\nsegments so they are precisely doing\nthat and if you check here is the new\nbusiness category that company has\nrecently Diversified its product\nportfolio by adding frozen fish product\nBasmati poultry and other agre products\nright so expand definitely C and this is\nsomething that you can go and check on\nthe fixed assets of the balance\nsheet\nfixs so it is highest ever so these\nfixed assets are going to bring more\nrevenues in\ntime for example in 2019 the total\ncapacity or total fixed asset 84 now it\nis how much it is almost three times so\nyeah three times revenues three times\nprofit and if economies of scale then\nthe profits might be much higher now of\ncourse these are all good points so now\nnext you go and check on promoters that\nwhat has been their background so up\nresearch then you will be able to figure\nout some more details about the\npromoters basically you just need to\nstudy the background management\ncommentary you will realize that this is\nfourth generation business\nand then they get insights so that is\ndefinitely a positive point for\ntheany of course you can go and study\nmore research reports Etc now you need\nto study all these reports with a\nnegative lens right negative lens you\nare definitely studying all this to find\nred flags within the company the first\nwas the production\nfacility\nfac right then I read that okay what is\nthe company doing so they have actually\ninstalled more Tech based Solutions then\nyou have to check certifications\ncertifications facili they are approved\nby all these different countries so I\nmean this is a point but this can become\na pain point in the future regular\ncompan so this is a weak point about the\nbus and hopefully they will be able to\ndo\nit is Indian government trying to\npromote this industry or not so\ngovernment when it comes to export of\nmeat products from India they are\nactually supporting it and they are\nearmarking a lot of money for this\nactivity the second key red flag on the\nbusiness is dependence excessively on\none country so if you go and look at the\nlocation wise breakup of export you will\nsee that dependence on Vietnam is close\nto\n33% that what has been the hygiene\nstandards or what has been the import\nstandards in Vietnam so Vietnam meat\nconsumption is very very\nhigh major strong Supply chains so they\nhave to import but till what time is\nthis game going to continue so these are\nsmall small points that you need to\ncheck because if Vietnam is developing\nits own capacity\nor then it becomes an issue but India\nhas very good relations with Vietnam and\nthis is one of the industries in which\nIndia and Vietnam have good Corporation\nso at least short term this is going to\nfall off but whenever you are investing\nin export oriented products please be\ncognizant of the fact that how\nDiversified it is final point is company\ngrow are there any red flags around that\njust for example will they be able to\ncrack more developed markets in the\nfuture will they be able to supply for\nexample fish in countries like Vietnam\nHong Kong already they have suppliers\nDistributors so can that be done\nsoat by reading all the literature on\nthe company so I'm not issuing a\nrecommendation whether you should buy it\nwhether you should not buy it I'm just\nsimply sharing the framework so in\nsummary here are the few key things that\nI will outline that number one micro cap\ninvesting is very very rewarding no\ndoubt about that number two there is\nvery less information on micro cap\ninvesting clear information\nyou will have to go by certain gut\nassumptions number three if you use the\nfourpoint framework that I have taught\nyou in this particular video then you\nwill be able to avoid major mistakes\nthat anyone could make in micro cap\ninvesting number four in order to truly\nbenefit from micro cap investing you\nwill have to take some direct exposure\nto micro\ncaps whenever massive growth happens in\nit and it's always a good time to book\nlittle bit of profit just 4X 5x stock\nthen you should definitely book some\nprofits on that particular stock finally\nin terms of micro cap investing one\npoint that I have not covered was\nregarding the shareholding pattern of\npromoters and the cleanliness of the\npromoter and you can also check how F\nand diis are behaving in that stock for\nexample\nH for example promoters have very high\npromoter holding so\n83.1% as per rules\nso are F buying this stock yes they have\npresence in this stock\nalready but for example\n835 and or F pick that holding then that\nwill be a very strong point for these\ntype of stocks right and\nfinally risk is very 15 15\n20 you know there are such very good\nchance that it might correct stock\nI hope that you enjoyed watching this\nvideo on tomorrow's YouTube member\nCommunity I'm going to speak about a\ncouple of micro caps and I will give you\nmore detailed summary regarding the same\nthank you so much for watching and I'll\nsee you soon",

sorry six\ntill 6 months ago which government was\nthere it's not my role now to talk Hy\nDori it was no it's not introspect\nplease I have no role in fact in fact I\nwould have to follow it\n100% so this apprehension that some\nstates are being discriminated against\nis a politically viated narrative which\nI'm sorry to say vested interests are\nhappy to go about saying it there's just\nnot a possibility that any Finance\nMinister can intervene to say I don't\nlike this state stop the payment no way\nit cannot happen that way madam\nso the Devolution of taxes including GST\neverything has been prescribed by our\nconstitutions and it is and\nconstitutional mandate which is to be\nabided by you but mam don't take it\notherwise there is a general perceptions\nbeing grown Across the\nNation that non-bjp ruled states are\nbeing deprived from having their\nlegitimate due\nthe latest example is Karnataka where\nthe entire Ministry has been agitating\nagainst the indiscriminate and arbitrary\nattitude of your\nadministrations they are alleging that\nthey are being\nfamed by sheer discrimination being\nplayed from your\nministry I would like to\nknow\nwhether state government of\nkatak has been deprived from obtaining\ntheir legitimate due because few months\nago the situation was not there that\ntime everything was going hunky D but\nafter the new installation of government\nbecause the non-bjp government has been\nassumed there since then that trouble\nhas been started on what is the reason\nbehind this kind of\ndeprivation Tamil\nNAD\nsir Devolution to the States this is\nbeyond of course this question sir but\nstill because it's an important question\non which the leader of the opposition is\nasking a question I would certainly\nrespond Devolution to the states happens\nin the Direct Tax\nMatters as per the recommendation given\nby the finance\ncommission the\nGST particularly the SG St the state GST\ngoes 100% to the states no one can do\nanything with it it has automatic\nprovision that 100% collected by the\nstates will be with them I repeat 100%\nis with\nthem\nigst is collected because it involves a\nlot of Interstate\npayments it is periodically reviewed\nalso by the GST Council it is because\nbecause State should get the money in\ntheir hand roughly grossly 50% is\ndivided and then periodically it is\nreadjusted to\nactuals so if a state were to get 41 and\nnot\n50 adjustment happens if a state were to\nget 52 adjustment happens so every now\nand then when money gets accumulated\nunder the\nigst it is divided grossly at 50/50 to\nall states and gets reconciled over the\ntime according to the data that comes\nup the\ncgst is divided as per the advice 42%\ngoost of the finance commission so if\nthis is direct tax GST sir direct\ntaxation is completely determined by the\nproportions decided and suggested and\naccepted and implemented by the central\ngovernment now of course some states and\nthis rate fixation is nothing to do with\nthe government of India rate fixation as\nto how much should go to a state is done\nby the finance commission and does the\nfinance commission sit in one place and\ntake a call on it no it goes all over\nmeets with every state government talks\nto them and only then submits the\nreport I want to humbly Summit before\nyou so that\nadir G please\nunderstand I

    "transcript": "Mom had approached your dad\nwith a marriage proposal for you.\nBut dad refused.\nOkay, I get it now, dad.\nYou came up with a good plan.\nThe perfect way to\nconvince me for marriage.\nLast time, it was a matrimonial\nsite and now it's this.\nWell done.\nWhat are you saying?\nWhat matrimonial site?\nWhat is she saying?\nYou were also here.\nYou're also here.\nBoth of you have heard what I said.\nDid I talk of marriage even once?\nDid I even mention\nthe word? No, right?\nYou may not have\nsaid it, but I can hear it.\nThen clean your ears.\nYou're hearing too much.\nYour ears are ringing.\nDad, please sit. Drink some water.\nI'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.\nLast time, you said that\nyou don't want to get married.\nI stopped talking about marriage.\nBecause I respected your decision.\nAt least, respect my\ndecision too. Even if you don't,\nbut at least don't interfere in it.\n[music playing]\nLook, if you manage your life,\nthen automatically my\nlife will get managed too.\nYou're after me all the time.\nJust like a tail.\nDad...\nWhy are you talking\nto her like this?\n[music playing]\n[thudding]\n- Dad...\n- Don't touch me.\nNo one will mess with\nmy belongings now.\n- Otherwise, I will...\n- Otherwise what, Mr. Sharma?\nI'm leaving tomorrow\nand that is final.\nAll three of you take\ncare of each other.\n[music playing]\nYou have a problem with\nme, Mr. Jaidev Sharma?\nI don't care even a bit.\nYes, drink cold water.\nMake your throat sore.\nI'll keep meddling like this.\nYou're dancing on my head.\nYes, I will dance on your\nhead. Do you have a problem?\n[door closes]\nWow! What a father-daughter duo!\nIt looks like we were\npicked up from a trash can.\nNo, sister.\nWe were born in this house.\nYou...\nYou're my most stubborn daughter.\nSo stubborn!\nCrazy girl, I...\nI can't see you sad\neven for a moment.\nWhatever I'm doing\nis because you're forcing me to.\nI'm doing all this for\nyour well-being, dear.\nI'm sorry, dear.\nI'm sorry.\nI'm sorry.\nShe is used to\nthe comforts of her\nhouse. Nothing else.\nBut who will explain to her, mom,\nthat talent alone doesn't suffice?\nThat's right.\nLook at yourself.\nHad you been caught\nup with household\nchores, would you\nhave worked in a bank?\nAnd now, look at you, you have\nan identity, your individuality.\nA few people know you.\nOtherwise, you'd have\njust been busy with chores.\nI'm saying, shall we have tea?\nYou've worked enough.\n- But...\n- I won't let\nanyone come in between\nme, my tea and my wife.\n[music playing]\nThank you.\nIt's good.\nIt's very good.\n[laughing]\nThank you, Aparna.\n- Hey!\n- Hmm?\nWhy are you sulking?\nNothing, dad.\nHe's angry with a girl.\nOf course. I had recommended her.\nYou're angry with her because you\nrecommended her and she refused.\nSo?\nSo? Who's wrong here?\nCome on, mom. Not again. Dad, why\nare you quiet? Tell her who's wrong.\nOkay, wait.\nNo, dear. You assumed\nthat she should go to Dubai.\nAnd she refused. Did you ask her?\nWhat's there to ask?\nYou did the same thing with Anurag.\nYou entered his name\nin the poetry competition\nbecause he was good with poetry.\nBut did you ask him?\nOne second, why are\nyou delving into the past?\nI was in school then,\nthis was in sixth grade.\n- We're adults now.\n- But you're still the same.\nSince childhood, you've\nremained just the same.\nWithout giving it enough\nthought, or seeking permission,\nyou make decisions on their behalf.\nAnd when something goes\nwrong, then you get upset.\nWhatever, mom. But\nI don't agree with this.\nHer decision was\nwrong. It was a no-brainer.\nYes, then don't agree,\nbut think about it.\nIt's possible that the girl\nmight have her compulsions.\nWhat compulsions?\nI don't know.\nShe must have her reasons.\nIn fact, I liked her decision.\nShe didn't come under\npressure and take a decision.\nShe knows exactly what she wants.\nIt's possible that she might want\nto get married, not go anywhere.\nShe might want to\nlive with her family.\nAt least, she knows\nwhat is more important to her.\nI'll go and help\nKusum in the kitchen.\n[chopping sound]\nI have given you my\nentire life, my entire youth.\nWill you three snatch\naway my old age too?\n[chopping sound]\nYou'll cut your finger.\nSister, do you also feel that\nit's my fault?\nYou sense something about dad.\nIt's possible that you're correct.\nBut...\nIt's also possible that you're\ngetting worried needlessly.\nMaybe we're overthinking about him.\nIf he wants to go, then let him.\nWe keep telling him that he\ndoesn't have friends and relatives,\nand now when he wants to go to\nmeet his friend, we're stopping him.\nAssume that this is his\nvacation after retirement.\nStop being angry and let him go.\nSister, don't forget\nto take the pickle.\nOtherwise, dad will\nget upset with me for it.\nOh!\n- Take care. Don't be angry.\n- Hmm.\nTanu.\nDad, we're leaving.\n[music playing]\nDad, we're leaving.\nDad!\n[music playing]\nBye. Take care.\nYou too.\n[music playing]\n[music playing]\nOh! Thanks so much, Varun.\nI was feeling very stressed.\nThis entire area is stiff.\nYou know, dad and Pallu\nwere fighting like kids today.\nIf I shut one up, the\nother started shouting.\nBoth of them were so angry.\nIt was a very intense argument.\nYou don't get so stressed.\nYou always say that they\ncan't be without each other.\nAnd I'm telling you,\nin just two hours,\nboth of them would be\ncooking in the kitchen together.\nWanna bet?\nActually, that's true.\nBy the way,\nmy meeting with the\ninvestor went very well today.\n- Really?\n- I'm very positive.\nI'll surely get the\nfunding this time.\nFinally, everything\nwill get on track.\nTouch wood. You've\nworked hard, Varun.\n[music playing]\nHey!\nJust working hard isn't\nenough. One needs support.\nAnd you've given me that, always.\nAnd that's why, I\nwas able to do all this.\nLet it be. That's not true.\nI don't say it.\nBut that doesn't\nmean that I don't see it.\n[kissing]\nBut you'll see,\nas soon as our investors'\nfunding gets cleared,\nyou can do whatever you want.\n- And first of all, quit your job.\n- Are you sure?\nYes.\nAnd after that, we'll\nbuy a holiday home.\nEither in Manali or Goa. You decide.\nOkay.\n[phone beeps]\n- Holiday home...\n- One moment.\n[music playing]\nThe management has found out\nabout the incident on the flight.\nThey're a bit upset and\nwant to meet you tomorrow.\nAll of you are our servants.\nWe're available at your service.\nBut we are not your\npersonal servants.\nTwo people were\nfired from the job today.\nNowadays, all airlines\nare cutting costs.\nThey just need excuses\nto fire all the staff.\n[footsteps approaching]\n[music playing]\n[music playing]\nHe's getting old, but\nhis actions are like a kid.\n'He's acting as if he's\nactually going to leave.'\n'I know that he won't go anywhere.'\n'He'll be at home when\nI return in the evening.'\n[traffic sound]\nWho brought these cupcakes?\nMe.\nIsn't it nice?\nI don't know. If\nI'm told after tasting\nthat you've been fired\nfrom the job. Then?\nNo, you're not losing your job.\nI was just pretending\nthat I can also bake.\nTry.\nOh, I thought that\nmaybe you've realised your mistake.\nThat's why you\nbrought this to say sorry.\nSorry for what?\n[music playing]\nI usually don't get\nso angry with anyone.\nWhat happened? Did you\ndrink bitter tea in the morning?\nHere's something sweet.\nPallavi, I agree that we\nstarted on the wrong foot.\nThat's why, let's start over.\nWith a smile.\nOkay.\n[music playing]\n[music playing]\nHmm. It's nice.\nI know, I made it after all.\nYou won't work today.\nHmm.\nExcuse me.\nEveryone. Can I have your attention?\nAll of you, please.\nGuys, no one's going to work today.\nI thought that we work every\nday, all through the week\nonly for our customers, right?\nThen why not give ourselves\nsome time on one day?\nWork for ourselves.\nServe ourselves.\nWhat do you think?\nSo, this is the new policy\nof this hotel from now.\nOne day every week.\nFor a few hours, this restaurant\nwill be open only for us.\nWe will cook for ourselves.\nWe'll serve ourselves.\nWe will be our own guest.\n[clapping]\nWhat are you waiting for?\nLet's cook for ourselves.\nOkay? I'll join you\nguys too, come on.\nIf you hand me the knife in\nmy hand, it leads to a fight.\nThank you so much for\nsaving me from a fight.\nOtherwise, it's\nvery difficult to be a\ndelivery boy and bring\ncupcakes everyday.\nI mean, to bake cupcakes.\n[music playing]\n- Shall we begin?\n- Yeah.\nTanu, give me something\nto eat. I'm starving.\n[music playing]\nTanu?\n[music playing]\n[music playing]\nSandwiches and coffee.\nWhere's the milk?\n[milk pouring]\n[music playing]\nWhere's the coffee?\nSo you're hiding here.\nOh no!\nOh!\nOh!\nWho is it? Rakesh, what are you\ndoing in the kitchen at this hour?\nMom, I was just\ntrying to make coffee\nand I broke the jar. That's it.\nGlass! Step back,\ndear. You'll get hurt.\nMom, I'm fine.\nRakesh, why did you come to the\nkitchen? You could've woken me up.\nAnd how did this jar break?\nWhat do you mean? He's not\nused to working in the kitchen.\nMoreover, I have never\nlet Rakesh enter the kitchen.\nAnd you're blaming him instead.\n- Where were you?\n- Mom, it's okay.\n- But son...\n- Mom, Tanvi has a fever.\nHuh?\nI came to make coffee\nbecause she had fallen asleep.\nOtherwise, she'd never\nlet me enter the kitchen.\nTake care of yourself, dear.\nIt's Rahul's birthday\ntomorrow, dear.\nIf you don't attend\nit, it won't look nice.\nMom, please go and\nrest. I'll clean everything.\n- We'll manage this. Don't worry.\n- Okay, I'll go and rest.\n- I'll go.\n- I'll drop you.\n[glass clinking]\nWhat are you doing?\nHave you gone mad?\n- Rakesh, please go out. I'll do it.\n- Tanu, you're unwell.\nAnd it's Rahul's birthday tomorrow.\nYou've to get fit by tomorrow.\nI'll do all this, don't worry.\n[crickets chirping]\nTa-da!\nPiping hot coffee and sandwiches.\nHere, have some coffee.\nThank you.\nTanu, I was thinking that\nit's Rahul's birthday tomorrow,\nso why not book a nice hotel\nand celebrate his birthday lavishly?\nBut why a hotel?\nTanu, you're unwell.\nAnd I know that you'll\nbe stressed all day.\nI don't want that, that's why.\nBut Rakesh, it'll be very expensive.\nOh god!

It'll get cold.\nHow is it?\n[grinning]\n[coughing]\nTanu, how will our child speak\nthe truth when the mom is a liar?\nBut I'll drink it.\n[gate opening]\n[gate closing]\n[music playing]\nDad?\n[music playing]\nWhy is the house so silent?\nDad?\nDad!\nDad!\nDad!\n[door opening]\n'I'm leaving tomorrow\nand that is final.'\nDad!\nDad!\nHe really left.\n'I'm leaving tomorrow\nand that is final.'\n[sobbing]\nThere's only half an hour left\nfor the flight.\n[music playing]\n[sobbing]",

    "transcript": "here we are after the long wait we are\ngoing to be giving you a timeline for\nspring 2025 everything you need to do\nright from today to the point you send\nin your applications and later is in\nthis video all you need to do is give me\n5 to 10 minutes of your attention and\nI'll cover everything you need to know\nwith my experience of more than 5 years\nand sending 5,000 plus students overseas\nto almost any part of the world that you\ncan think of all right\nthe first thing we're going to do is\nwe're going to come back to ymg grad.com\nright we can go onto the Articles page\nhere and in the Articles search for\ntimeline now there's a fall timeline and\nthere's a spring timeline we're going to\ngo on to the spring timeline and while\nthere's everything detailed over here in\nthis article we're not going to go over\nit in this video what I want to do is I\nwant to open up this image in a new tab\nand I want to focus on this today with\nyou I want to do this oneon-one\neverything you need to know is really in\nthis image itself all right so we move\nforward with the timeline and this\nstarts from February that's great\nbecause this video is being made in\nJanuary towards the end of January\nessentially so that's great right the\nfirst thing over here that it says is\nthat you start preparing for GR and tofl\nbut take this with a grain of salt\nunderstand who you are what your\nrequirements are maybe you're going for\nan MBA in that case you should take\ninstead of the gr you should take GMAT\nright maybe you're going for Canada in\nthat case you should instead of tofl you\nshould take um Al right it depends from\na case by case perspective but whatever\nyour tests are you have to take them\nusually there will be one to two tests\nif you're going to the US there will be\ntwo right if you're going overseas and\nyou're pursuing MBA there will still be\ntwo otherwise there will be one in most\ncases right you understand your test\nfirst you need to know the minimum\nrequirements of the universities you\ncheck them out for any University you'll\nfind out your test all right but mostly\nyou guys are going to be taking GR and\ntofl or G and El and whichever you know\none of these combinations you do you're\ngoing to be fine no matter where you\nwant to go in the worldall this\ncombination works generally very well\nright um moving forward the other thing\nyou need to understand is what do you do\nfrom February\nitself when do you finish it so you\nstart preparing for the G and tofl in\nFebruary but you take your test Max to\nMax right over here you can see Max to\nMax by May to June okay we're going to\nfocus on this element by element I don't\nwant you to get stuck in the hotch Pod\nright you start the test preparation and\nby you can say May or June your test\nshould be finished off okay that's the\ninstruction here now that does not mean\nthat you cannot take your test earlier\nyou can finish them off in March you can\nfinish them off in April but finishing\noff of course means that you get good\nscores that you can actually showcase to\nuniversities all right so finish the\nthem off in that while by the way did\nyou know that if you sign up on ymg\ngrad.com\nslofer if you complete this page you\nwill get a lot of free study material\nfor you name it gr tofl Duolingo ALS\nGMAT all kinds of tests and you'll also\nget samples of Sops and L so make sure\nyou do that you should be signed up on\nour website you will get these samples\nright to your email delivered okay uh\npaid study material which is at a\ndiscount can also be found on this\nmaterial link where you will get up to\n70% off on some of the most popular\nstudy material all right but free study\nmaterial should be good enough to start\nwith okay moving forward that's your\ntest right the next thing you want to do\nis you want to make sure that you are\ncontinually improving your profile\nthroughout so that the definition of\nimprovement of your profile is different\nfrom person to person now if you're\nworking with us and you know you can\nwork with us from right now itself we\nwill what we like to do is and this can\nbe done by you as well that's why I'm\ntelling you that don't think this is an\nadvertisement you want to work with us\ngreat otherwise this is for you\nunderstand this listen you go ahead take\na look at some of your seniors right on\nour platform also it's free you can\ncheck out their profiles you can even\nchat with them if you want right take a\nlook at their resumes take a look at\nwhat they had on their resume that you\ndo not have on yours and these should be\npeople who are getting to your dream\nuniversities you know look at their\nprofiles if on our platform itself you\ncan do that kind of research you can\nbasically look at people's profiles you\ncan understand okay if uh my goal is to\nget into USC then okay what kind of\npeople were getting admits from USC in\nthe past you take a look at their their\nprofiles you take a look at what kind of\ncgpa they had what kind of resume they\nhave if you open up their profile right\nhere you can open up the you know resume\nas well if you want for many of these\npeople right so you do all of that\nresearch by yourself now when you have\nactually done it you would know what's\nmissing on your resume and what that\nmeans is now you have the power to\nactually actually acquire all of those\nthings that were missing on your profile\nbefore right that's what we do for you\nas well we tell you hey you focus on\nyour tests we focus on your applications\nwe do the research for you we we see\nwhat's missing we let you know so that\nyou can work on it now normally for\nengineers if you're an engineer or if\nyou're going in the field of Mis\nmeem even MBA many times what matters a\nlot is research work so you can focus on\nadding that and you can even find people\nfor adding that on our website again so\nwe have basically built everything you\ncan go on discussion say I want to\npublish a research paper in this field\nwho's interested in joining me and then\npeople will reply over here like that\nright now this is free you can do that\nall by yourself if you want to basically\npublish it to us then you can create a\nresearch group over here this is\nchargeable this is not free but you will\nfind people directly and this will\nactually happen in real time we have\nlike a whole portal and everything where\nyou can see progress and all everything\nis there all right\nnow that was just an an example research\npapers is just one part of it could be\npatents could be you know gaining some\nexperience could be anything dependent\non who you are right for mbas for\ninstance 3 to 5 years of experience is\nalmost mandatory now moving forward you\nunderstand this continual profile\nguidance part I suppose right you\nunderstand this preparing for the test\npart that part we're clear about next we\nmove on and what we really want to do is\nlook if you're working by yourself\nespecially you want to do this early you\nwant to start preparing your Sops and\nrecomend recommendation letters many\ntimes your recommenders also will ask\nyou to prepare their recommendations in\nadvance and you have to deliver it to\nthem and then they will sign off on it\nand scan it trust me 90% of the\nrecommenders are like that 10% want to\nwrite it themselves but 90% they don't\nbecause they have their own life as well\nright so what you do is you start in\nadvance because you're doing it for the\nfirst time if you're doing it with us we\ncan do it in a couple weeks a couple\ndays but when you're doing it the first\ntime it takes a lot lot of research so\nthat's why I put it here march to April\nyou should already start working on\nthese I'm not saying that the finalized\nversion but already start working on it\nso that you know by the time you reach\nthe admission stages you have these\ndocuments with you and these application\nsubmission stages start somewhere around\nMay June right so as long as you can get\ndocuments ready by then you are fine\nyou're good to go but you should be\nending up with something that you my\nfriend are happy with right next let's\nmove forward uh of course if you're\nworking with us IV Le grads will writing\nyour drafts who have already made it to\nthe top most universities worldwide\nmostly in the US they'll be the ones\nwriting your draft anyway let's move\nforward so the next part over here is\nokay you're done with your profile\nImprovement you're done with your GRE\nGMAT is sat dingo whatever you're done\nwith your Sops and LS and everything's\nready right you by the way you need to\ngner transcripts that's not something\nthat I've mentioned but I think that's\nuh quite obvious because when you read\nthe University requirements you will\nfind it there you need to have\ntranscripts that's all after that comes\nthe application submission stage very\nimportant I don't want you to rush\nthis if you're doing it for the first\ntime by yourself I don't want to rush\nthis period I want you to focus on each\nand every part of the application and\ntreat it as if it's like your baby you\ndo not want to mess this up you do not\nwant a spelling mistake anywhere if they\nask you to record a video generally what\nwe do is we give you a script word by\nword if let's say you have an interview\ntomorrow right we'll train you for the\ninterview we'll be doing all of that but\nif you're doing it alone by yourself you\nhave to do all that research by yourself\nit takes time all right so you make sure\nyou fill up everything properly you\nshould by default know essentially what\nkind of scholarships you eligible for so\nyou can also apply to them sometimes\ntheir additional s is required and all\nof this takes time you know every single\napplication will take probably a week if\nnot uh more right and that's okay okay\nthat's why I'm giving you this time\ntimeline here all right hopefully by\nJune essentially everything's ready you\nhave all all the things that I talked\nabout and you start submitting\napplications right June July August you\nsend in your applications still a good\ntime for spring all right you send in\nyour applications and after that I don't\nwant you to delay it after September\nOctober I mean you can potentially do it\nit's possible to apply even in November\nbut really it's going to cause issues\nfor your Visa all right by October I\nwant you to have every everything done\nbecause that's really when you start\nreceiving the admits from the University\nso you will start receiving admissions\nif you applied earlier by the way around\nJune you'll start receiving them from\nSeptember itself so you receive\nadmissions letter from the universities\noh and by the way I skipped a little bit\nof an important part over here you don't\njust take the test you also short list\nuniversities and short listing is an\nimportant part do not compromise on it\nit's very important that you do it the\nright way if you do it the wrong way\nit's going to be a problem so apply to\nthe right universities where people like\nyou have gotten scholarships before you\ncan use the decision space to understand\nall of that it's insanely helpful now\ngetting back to the schedule once you\nreceive the admits around September\nOctober November it's time to apply for\nthe Visa now if you're doing it for the\nUS for instance in that case you will\nwant to get the I20 you will want to\nstart applying for the Visa and trust me\nspring has the maximum deferrals people\ndon't get to go in Spring if they don't\nstart early so start early this is\nimportant important all right you have\nto figure out housing you have to figure\nout your Visa it's a lot of work all\nright so make sure that November to\nDecember essentially you should be\nfocused on that so that in January you\ncan fly out easily all right and that's\nmy friend your entire plan for the\nspring 2025 term I hope that this helps\nif you need any help we're always there\nwe have done this for more than 5,000\ncandidates you can take a look at the\nservices page you can reach out to me on\nWhatsApp using this exact button right\nhere um you can take a look at the\ncomplete applicational where will take\ncare of your entire process really A to\nZ everything we'll have counseling\nsessions Unlimited in that and there's a\nlot more that we do but again I don't\nwant to make this video long if you'd\nlike to understand how I can help you\nyou can reach out to me on Whatsapp in\nall the the cases thank you so much for\nwatching this make sure you subscribe to\nthe channel because there's a lot more\ncontent like this that is coming your\nway and you can follow me on Instagram\nfor a lot different content where\nthere's opportunities posted

    "transcript": "Hello, friends!\nRecently on 22nd January,\nRam Mandir was inaugurated in Ayodhya\nIn the Praan Prathistha event.\nPraan means life,\nPratistha means establishment.\nThis is the ceremony where\nan idol is installed inside the temple.\nFor the last few weeks, this ceremony\nhas been discussed exhaustively \nin the newspapers and media.\nThis aroused many controversies too.\n\"The devotees all over the country are waiting\nfor the time when Ram Lala's life \nwill be established in the temple.\"\n\"My flying chariot has brought me to \nthe Lakshman Fort now.\"\n\"Pakistan is chanting Jai Shree Ram too!\"\n\"He is only drinking coconut water for 11 days.\"\n\"He worked tirelessly for 18 hours \nonly then did Modi find Ram.\"\nSome political parties and 4 main Shankaracharyas\ndid not attend this event.\nLet's understand these events in this video\nbut at the same time,\nI would like to use this opportunity\nto discuss the qualities of Shri Ram in this video.\nBecause it is very easy to talk about Ram\nbut to learn from the values and principles of Shri Ram\nand to apply them to yourself \nis very difficult.\nI have already made two videos on Ramayana.\nIn the first one, I talked about\nhow some people try to justify Ravana.\nAnd in the second one, I talked about\nthe allegations made against Ram by some people.\nHow he killed Shambhuk, a person from the lower caste.\nHow he abandoned his wife Sita.\nI presented a lot of evidence\nto show that the Uttar Kaand\nis a later addition to the Ramayana.\nAlong with that, I also talked \nabout the history of Ramayana.\nIs Ramayan based on a true story\nor is it just a literary work?\nBoth the videos are linked in the description below.\nFor those who haven't watched them already.\nIn this context, in this video\nI would like to tell you about the qualities of Shri Ram.\nAnd how it can change your life.\nAnd it doesn't matter whether you are\na Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain,\nParsi or even an Atheist.\nAnd as always, I will quote the sources \nfrom Valmiki's original Ramayana.\nBut before that,\nlet's talk about this event.\nWho went to this inauguration ceremony,\nwho didn't, and why didn't they go?\nThe senior leaders of the BJP, \nLK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi,\nhave been the biggest leaders of the Ram \nMandir Agitation Movement since the 1990s.\n\"The place where Lord Ram was born,\nno power can stop the construction of the temple there.\nAnd the temple will be built there!\"\nBut he did not attend this grand inauguration.\nThe general secretary of the Ram \nTemple Trust told the reporters that\nconsidering his age,\nhe was told not to come to this inauguration.\nBut on the other hand, Bollywood celebrities\nlike Katrina Kaif, Rohit Shetty, Ranbir Kapoor, and Alia Bhatt\nwere given special invitations.\nAmong the political parties,\nmany individuals got the invitation\nbut they rejected it for various reasons.\nLike CPI(M)'s general secretary, \nSitaram Yechury said that\nreligion is a personal matter.\n\"I said, \"Religion is the individual choice of every individual.\nWe respect and we safeguard (it).\"\" \nHe said that the Indian constitution and \nthe Supreme Court has clearly stated that\nthe government cannot be affiliated \nwith any particular religion.\nSo, on the basis of secularism,\nhe rejected this invitation.\nShiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray,\nwho got the invitation just two days before the event,\nthrough speed post,\nrejected it and his party member Sanjay Raut said that\nthough BJP worships Ram,\nthey rule like Ravan.\nHe said that he keeps going to Ayodhya\nand will go in future too.\nBut on this day of 22nd January,\nhe went to Kalaram Temple in Nashik.\nThe temple where it is believed that\nLord Rama, Lakshman, and Sita \nstayed at during their exile.\nMany leaders of the Congress Party were invited\nbut they rejected the invitation saying that\nthe temple being inaugurated even though \nit is only partially completed.\nTheir main reason behind rejecting the invitation was that\nBJP was politicising the event.\nThey were using Ram's name for elections and politics.\nSome people have praised this stance\nsaying that it was a good decision by Congress,\nbut on the other hand, some people have said that\nit was a political blunder.\nBut the point of inaugurating this incomplete temple\nwas also raised by the Shankaracharyas.\nIt is that about 1,200 years ago\nAdi Shankaracharya had established \nfour principal mathas in four directions.\nThese were in present-day Uttarakhand,\nGujarat, Karnataka and Odisha.\nEach Matha has a chief priest,\nwho is known as a Shankaracharya.\nSince there are four Mathas, \nthere are four Shankaracharyas.\nNone of these four attended this event.\nThe Shankaracharya in Puri, \nNischalananda Saraswati said that\nthis ceremony was not according to Hindu scriptures.\n\"There should be a proper ceremony.\nIf we revere Ramji,\nthen Ramji was a respectable person, right?\nRamji's establishment into the idol \nshould be in accordance with the Shastras.\"\nShankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, \nfrom the Uttarakhand Matha,\nexplained this thing.\n\"The temple is considered as the body of God.\nThe peak of the temple is said to be the eyes of God.\nThe pot, his head\nand the flag on the temple\nis considered the hair of God.\nSo according to him, a body\nwhich has no eyes or head,\nit is not right to bring life into it.\nHe says that it goes against the scriptures.\nSince he could not see the violations of the scriptures,\nhe did not attend the ceremony.\nBut because of this one decision,\nthe IT cell on social media\ntried to defame him relentlessly.\nFake news was spread targetting him\nand some accounts even called him an anti-Hindu.\nLook at these photos.\nSome accounts shared these photos on social media\nsaying that this Shankaracharya\nhad gone to Ajmer Sharif.\nHe went to visit religious places of Muslims,\nand so they called him an anti-Hindu.\nFirst of all, as I have told you in previous videos,\nAdi Shankaracharya's core philosophy\nwas of non-duality.\nOne thing that is repeatedly said in this is that\nAham Brahmasmi.\nThat is, God is present in everything and everywhere.\nAnd if God is present in everything,\nthere is no distinction between \nHindus, Muslims, Brahmins, and Shudras,\neveryone is a reflection of the same Brahma.\nSo, according to Adi Shankaracharya's philosophy,\nit doesn't matter if\na Shankaracharya goes to a mosque, \na Gurudwara or a Church,\nGod resides everywhere.\nBut the second point here is that\nthis news was false.\nA person with Shankaracharya, \nArvind Guru, who had gone there,\nsaid that this was not a Muslim place of worship,\nthis was a Hindu Ashram.\nThis was Ramdev Pir's court,\nwho is considered an avatar of Krishna.\n\"This photo is from a court,\nof Ramdev Pir\nwho is considered as a Krishna avatar.\"\nDuring an interview with Karan Thapar,\nShankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati \nwas asked the same question.\nHe said that he never went to Ajmer,\nso how could the photo be from Ajmer Sharif?\n\"Till now, there hasn't been an opportunity\nwhen I could go to Ajmer city.\nIf I haven't gone to Ajmer city,\nthen how could I have gone to Ajmer Sharif?\"\nAnd he also said that\neven if he went to a Dargah for some reason,\nit wouldn't mean that he became a Muslim.\nThe IT cell and the biased media\nhave declared PM Modi a more devoted \nHindu than these Shankaracharyas.\nSome even call him Vishnu's avatar.\nBut they forget that PM Modi has also gone to a Dargah.\nHas he become a Muslim?\nAnother fake news was spread to defame these Shankaracharyas\nthat they had taken ₹500,000\nto reject the invitation to this inauguration.\nThis news was baseless and without evidence.\n\"You are a journalist, that doesn't mean\nyou will publish anything.\n\"satisfied with ₹500,000 rupees\"\nYou publish such things about a Shankaracharya.\nAnd when the Shankaracharya asks you for your sources,\nyou can't give a clarification.\nHow do you know about ₹500,000?\nWho paid this? \nWhere and when?\nTell us.\"\nSeeing this, Shankaracharya was shocked.\nAfter all, why would any entity spread \nsuch defamatory news without any evidence\nto defame Shankaracharya?\nOne thing is clear from this,\nin today's world,\nif you are against any decision by BJP or PM Modi\nand you speak your opinion in front of the public,\nthen you will not be spared from being defamed and insulted.\nWho is Hindu and who is anti-Hindu?\nTo certify this,\nthere's a standing army of incels.\nAnd the interesting thing is that\nthey don't actually care about Ram.\nThey just want to play politics using Ram's name.\n\"Say, 'Jai Shree Ram!'\"\nIf you ask them anything about Ram's principles,\nthey will have no idea about it.\nLinguists and historians\noften use the suffix \"Great\" \nwith the names of great kings.\nIf they conquered big territories.\nLike, King Alexander is called Alexander the Great.\nAnd we accept it without thinking.\nBut the reality is that\nAlexander was a bloodthirsty,\nshort-tempered, alcoholic, \nego-maniac, ruthless king\nwho killed hundreds of thousands of people.\nMany times he wiped out entire tribes at once.\nBut in contrast to this is the story of Lord Ram in Ramayana.\nWhen Ram was about to become the king,\neveryone was happy in Ayodhya.\nBut Rama's stepmother, Kaikeyi demanded that\ninstead of Ram, her son Bharat should be the king.\nAnd Ram would be exiled to the jungle for 14 years.\nWhat was Shri Ram's reaction to this?\nAyodhya Kand, Chapter 18, Shloka 41.\nitīva tasyāṃ paruṣam vadantyām |\nnacaiva rāmaḥ praviveśa śokam |\nThat is, though Kaikeyi's words were very harsh\nRam was not upset to hear this.\nNext we have the first shloka of chapter 19.\nśrutvā na vivyathe rāma\nIt means that hearing this, Ram did not get angry.\nHe was unruffled.\nAfter this, he consoled his father Dashratha\nand assured Kaikeyi that he would go into exile.\nThink about it, friends,\nhad this happened to you,\nhow would you feel?\nYou are going to be crowned the king.\nBut suddenly, not only is your crown taken away from you,\nbut you are told to go to the jungle for 14 years of exile.\nMany of us will be infuriated after hearing this,\nbut Ram did not even get upset here.\nCompare this to Ashok,\nwho k!lled his brothers to get power.\nAurangzeb did the same thing,\nk!lled his brother Dara Shikoh to become the emperor.\nPeople in Ayodhya were already supporting Ram.\nIf Ram wanted, he could have said,\nthat he was being treated unjustly.\nThat even though it wasn't his fault,\nhe was being sent to the jungle.\nHad he wanted, he could have become the king\nby putting Kaikeyi and Bharat in jail.\nBut he did not do that.\nIt is worth noting that\nthe people of Ayodhya were truly supporting Ram.\nIn chapter 17, it is written that\nthey wanted to see Ram become the king\nand wanted nothing more.\nBut what was the reason for this?\nIt is written in Shloka 15 \nabout how virtuous Rama was.\nHe had compassion for everyone.\nBut Rama calmly and peacefully decided\nto go live in jungles.\nChapter 19 Shloka 20 tells you \nabout what Rama said to Kaikeyi.\n\"O queen, I am not concerned with wealth.\nI want to be like a sage.\nabiding in righteousness alone.\nI want to receive the world hospitable.\"\nFor Rama, being on the throne did not mean that\nthe world would be at his feet.\nTo him, power meant that\nhe could serve the people.\nBut today, people's behaviour is just the opposite.\nPeople shamelessly say that\nthey are addicted to power.\nThey have no problem with \nfalling to any extent to get power.\nPeople use phrases like\n'everything is permissible in love and war.'\n'Salute the rising sun.'\n'The one with the stick owns the buffalo.'\n'I will support the one who has a chance to win.'\n'The one who wins is the king, \nthe one who loses is a monkey.'\nIn all these sayings,\npower and authority are being given a lot of importance.\nBut I want you to change your perspective.\nThink for yourself, who will be the winner here?\nA person who leaves behind all his \nmorality, values, and principles\njust to get power?\nOr a person who lets go of power\nwithout compromising on his morals, values, and principles?\nAnd while doing this, he had no ill feelings towards Kaikeyi.\nChapter 19, Shlok 24, he had only one complaint to Kaikeyi,\nhe asked her if she wanted to make Bharat the king,\nwhy did she tell this to King Dasharatha?\nWhy didn't she tell Rama directly?\nHe accused her of not trusting him.\nSo we get a straightforward lesson here\nof humility, compassion, and forgiveness.\nIf you lost something while protecting your morality,\nthen did you even lose anything?\nBut if you gave up your morality to get something,\ndid you actually win?\nFriends, if you liked this video,\nyou will definitely like my previous \nvideo on Valmiki's Ramayana.\nYou can click here to watch it.\nThank you very much!",

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH4G_SJPGyM",
    "transcript": "guys if you think that you have an\naverage profile this video is for you\nI'm going to be telling you first off\nwhat an average profile looks like to me\npersonally and then I'm going to be\ntelling you exactly what kind of\nuniversities should be in your short\nlist if you have this profile now an\naverage profile is not a bad profile\nunderstand this but it is not the\ntopmost profile either out there hence\nif I had to put it I would say that an\naverage profile is pretty much quite\ndecent it's a decent profile it's a good\nprofile but it's not the best it's not\nthe worst I'll give you two examples the\nfirst one is an engineer he has a cgpa\nof eight zero years of work X that means\nno work experience yet and he has one\nresearch paper that he's able to publish\nin any random conference version now the\nsecond example I have for you is a\nmanagement professional she has a cgp of\n7.5 she has about 3.5 years of work\nexperience and one research paper now\nagain you might say that hey you know\nthese are a little bit above average or\nsomething but I would say that most\napplicants that you work with most\napplicants have a profile like this and\nhence I wanted to make a video for you\nguys\nso what are the best 10 universities in\nthe US that I would recommend for you\nguys with the highest internal\ninvestment that you can genuinely get\ninto let's begin and guys remember these\nare not ranked so I would not say that\nthe number one that I'm giving you in\nthis list is the best I'm not saying\nthat the number 10 is the worst no\nthat's not the case they're just 10\nuniversities that you may want on your\nlist\n[Music]\nthe first one in my list would be North\nEastern University if you look at this\nscatter plot right here which represents\nAdmissions rejections and applications\nof applicants who have registered on our\nwebsite you can see that a lot of people\napply to Nu first off it's a very\npopular University and all kinds of\nprofiles have been getting admits but\nlet me tell you it's not very easy to\nget an admit as well in a news so you\nwill see a lot of rejections as well but\nwhy I chose Nu for you today is number\none due to its location Advantage Boston\na lot of jobs around there in the\nMassachusetts area a lot of great\nschools out there including Harvard and\na lot of places where you can go for the\ncampus hiring also for the on-campus job\nperiods that happen the number two thing\nwhy I chose Northeastern is that it's\nthe best university I would say in the\nUS number one for Co-Op options what a\nco-op Co-op is alternating semesters you\nstudy you work you study you work that's\nhow it goes and that's why I would say\nyou should have Northeastern in your\nlist let's move on to University number\ntwo\nand that would be for the University now\nthis University would be the perfect fit\nfor the ambitious portion of your short\nlist as you can see here on this scatter\nplot a lot of people do get rejected but\nquite a few we have seen even with lower\ngpas and an average profile have also\ngotten accepted to point you Purdue has\nan excellent Market reputation and its\nlocation may not be the best but with\nthis reputation I am sure that I have\nnot seen even one person who has gone to\nPurdue from us at least who has not\ngotten a job at the end of their degree\nthe next one again to be added to your\nambitiousness over here would be Duke\nUniversity now Duke University is not\njust great in management programs but\nalso stem programs if you're studying\nengineering if you're studying tech\nthere could be one of the best\nuniversities you can go to it's got a\ndecent enough location and a great brand\nname so you will not have any issues\ngetting a job\nnumber four on my list would be Texas A\nand M the college station campus that's\nthe one I'm talking about guys now if\nyou see in the chart right over here in\nscatter plot you can very easily see\nthat if you have a GPA around eight or\neight plus Texas A M would accept you in\nmost cases just by seeing the chart you\ncan kind of draw a line between cgp 8\nand above to see that most of the cgp8\nplus applicants are being accepted also\ndid you know that if you're applying to\nany of the Texas universities you have\nthe Texas competitive scholarship\navailable that means if you're able to\nsecure at least a thousand dollar in\nscholarship for graduate applicants and\nFurniture graduates is four thousand but\nwe will secure that you are eligible for\nin-state tuition that means your tuition\non an annual basis is just about 15 to\n18 000 not more than that at any\nUniversity in Texas I can tell you\nthat's why I would add Texas A M to my\nlist and we've actually sent a lot of\nstudents with the scholarship to Texas A\nM and many other schools in Texas\nUniversity number five\nASU Arizona State University I'm gonna\ntell you a few pointers here extremely\npopular of course the university is very\npopular you can see how many people have\nbeen applying on our website itself a\nlot of people are getting admits as well\nas you can see apart from that two more\nthings that you might be interested in\ngreat location great parties both are\npretty great that means you'll have a\ngood life you'll have the most amazing\ntime at the University and there will be\nno dirt of opportunities University\nnumber six\nNew York University no matter which\ncampus you're going for it's good for\nengineering it's good for management\nit's good for finance you know why great\nlocation that's what it Fosters the job\nopportunities for any of these fields\nwould be incomparable if you're going to\ninvite you on the scatter plot here you\ncan see and try to understand what kind\nof applicants get accepted but I've seen\nmost applicants with decent average\nprofiles would be able to get to NYU the\nnext one on my list\nis SUNY Buffalo this is the best\nuniversity in the State University of\nNew York system as you can see with the\nadmits and rejects you can probably add\nit to the safe or the moderate region of\nyour shortlist what this University will\ngive you again is a great location with\ngreat opportunities with Finance\nengineering or management so I would go\nwith it hands down if I have not been\nable to get a better University because\nwe've returned our investment repair is\ngoing to be great number eight and for\nthis one we're going back to Texas my\nfriend and that is\n[Music]\nUD Dallas University of Texas the Dallas\ncampus again as I explained the Texas\ncompetitive scholarship is something\nthat you will be able to Avail with UTD\nanother Factor over here UDD has a lower\ntuition than most other universities out\nthere in the whole of the US and a great\nranking in management and engineering\nprograms both so if you're in one of\nthese fields you may want to Target your\nteam remember guys in the last two or\nthree years what we've been seeing is\nthat UDD has started to become a little\nbit more GPA Centric that means even\nthough the startup plot over here will\nshow quite a lot of people have been\naccepted with six seven gpas that's\nreally not happening anymore so that's\nsomething you might want to look into\nUniversity number nine over here would\nbe\nSan Jose State University now why is\nthis one on my list the reason is that\nit's within 15 minutes from the Silicon\nValley it's very close that means\nthere's an immense amount of\nopportunities right there there's a\nmajor location advantage that you can\nuse and personally I would not skip out\non it from at least adding it to my\nsafer list of universities the ranking\nis not that great but the location\nreally takes away the position Point\nnumber 10 is going to be mostly like a\nsafety School\nso I would call this Stevens Institute\nof Technology as you can see most of the\npeople who have applied have been able\nto get admits there's barely any\nrejections but what I can tell you about\nthis University is that most of the\nalumni have been able to secure jobs so\nas for me at least this deserves a spot\non the safe list so guys those were the\n10 universities that you may want to\nfocus on if you have an average or a\nlittle bit of an above average profile\nif you like this

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaBItQ0QgNE",
    "transcript": "[Music]\nhi everyone\n[Music]\nhey guys i'm akshada and welcome to\nanother video so in today's video i am\ngoing to talk about three things so in\nthe first part we are going to discuss\nabout why did i apply to so many\nuniversities and in the second part i am\ngoing to talk about why you should not\nrepeat the same mistake and in the third\npart of the video i'll tell you which\nuniversities i had applied to my admits\nand my rejects i've added the different\ntime stamps in the description box below\nso please you can skip to the part that\nyou like and let's start with the video\nso i gave my gre in my second semester\nof third year\nand i scored a 306 so i was aiming for a\nscore of 310 and above and that's why i\nwas really disappointed\ni decided that i'm going to retake my\ngre but in the meantime i joined a\ncounselling agency to help me with my\napplication process\nso what happens when you join a\ncounseling agency is that they evaluate\nyour profile and then they give you a\nlist of universities that you should\napply to\nlike based on the profile i already had\nresearched on my end and i had a list of\nuniversities that i wanted to apply to\nso i discussed these universities with\nmy counselor and she told me that my gre\nscore is really low for these\nuniversities and i have to score 310 in\nmy next attempt in order to get an admit\nin this universities\nso then i gave my second attempt of gre\nand\ni again scored 306\nso again i was really disappointed but\nthere was not enough time that i could\nagain retake my gre and i had to give my\nil so i just decided that i am going to\ngo with\nthe gre score of 306\nthen i visited some education fairs in\nmy city and i used to ask them the same\nthing like i used to tell them my\nprofile and used to ask them that what\nare the chances of me being admitted\ninto your university and they used to\nreply me with the same thing that your\ngrt score is low and that is a 50 chance\nor there is a 60 chance so due to all\nthese things i will my confidence was\nreally low but love i used to think in\nmy mind that what if i apply to a\ncertain number of universities and i end\nup getting zero admits what then\nso because of this fear and uncertainty\ni just ended\nup applying to\n13 universities\ni know that's a lot but yeah i applied\nto 13 universities\nand this time i wanted to do mis so i\napplied to 13 universities the course\nwas mostly mis\nthen the covet 19 pandemic happened uh\nand i was\nactually\nyeah so after applying to 13\nuniversities i started getting admits\nfrom all these universities i only got\ntwo rejects so i was really happy but\nthen i was really confused about which\nuniversity should i go for it was very\nconfusing to come to a decision because\ni had so many options\nthen\nthe kobe 19 pandemic happened and i\ndecided to defer my admits so i\nshortlisted a few universities and i\ndeferred my admits for these\nuniversities\nand in the one year that i had i talked\nto the seniors and i talked to the\nalumni uh for the universities that i\nhad shortlisted and also i changed my\nmind so i decided that i have to do data\nanalytics and i don't want to do\nmanagement information systems\nso in fall 2021 i again applied to four\nuniversities\nalso in fall 2021 for many universities\nthe gre score was waved off so i thought\nthat you know let's just take a chance\nso i just applied to some more\nuniversities the in\n2021\nso in total i ended up applying to 13\nplus four universities\nso in conclusion i think the reason why\ni applied to so many universities was\nbecause i\nlike i would say that i was not\nconfident at all about my profile\ni was really fearful\nthen i think there was some lack of\nawareness and guidance i used to think\nthat gre score\nis only\nthe single factor that is going to\naffect your uh application decision\nso that's the reason that why i ended up\napplying to so many universities\nnow we come to the second point of part\nof this video\ni've just written down a couple of\npoints\nso i think the first main factor\nis that you'll end up spending a lot of\nmoney like really a lot of money\nso\nyou're like there so for some\nuniversities you will get some\napplication fee papers when you go to\nthe education\nfairs and if you join a counseling\nagency so you might think okay\napplication fee waiver\napplication\nbut it's not\nthe application fee that you have to pay\nyou have to pay for the gre score you\nhave to pay for the ielts score to reach\nthem you have to sometimes pay for the\ntranscripts uh to reach them so\nyou know you just end up spending a lot\nof money the application fee\ncosts uh\naround like 60 75 sometimes even 90\nso during fall 2020 i ended up spending\na huge amount of money just on\napplications and that's one reason why\nyou should not do it\nthe second reason that i would say is\nthat\nit will create a lot of confusion so let\nus say you apply to a lot of\nuniversities and you get admits from a\nlot of universities\nbut now\nyou will have so many options you will\nreally be confused about which\nuniversity you should go for because uh\nyou will talk to the people you'll ask\nthem about the university everyone is\ngoing to have a different perspective\nand every university has its own cons\nand its own pros so you're just going to\nbe confused about which is the best\nuniversity so i think\nthat you can just avoid this confusion\nby being prepared before applying\nand the last point is that\nit is a big waste of time and energy so\nmaking an application to the\nuniversities is not is not a small task\nyou have to write lor you have to write\na sop which is specific for that course\nand for that universities so every time\nyou make a sop you will have to go and\nresearch about that university about the\ncourse about the research and faculty\nthen you'll have to proofread that sop\nthen you'll have to fill the application\nform so overall it is a very time\nconsuming process\nso i will really recommend you to\nnot apply to many universities\nand i have made a list of some points\nthat you should consider before applying\nto the university universities so the\nfirst and the very main thing is that\nyou should know your course so like i\nyou know first i said that i want to do\nmis and then i changed my mind so\nyou should just be sure about what you\nwant to do\nabout which course\nthen the second thing that\nyou should consider is\nyou should make a list of two safe\nuniversities two\naverage universities and two ambitious\nuniversities according to your profile\nand i think six universities is really\nmore than enough and you should be\nconfident about yourself\nyou are going to get an admit from the\nuniversity just believe that and you\nwill get an admit from the university\nbut yes this doesn't mean that you\nshould just go and apply to any\nuniversity and expect an advert\njust uh compare your profile with\neveryone else and then a shortlist six\nuniversities and then be confident that\nyou will get an admit\nso now we come to the last part of the\nvideo\nfall 2020 like i said i applied to 13\nuniversities\nso i applied to njit\nnortheastern university\ni applied to pace university then uic i\napplied to university of texas at\narlington university of texas at dallas\nuniversity of south florida texas a m\nuniversity\nthen\nuh what else arizona state university\nand yeah red girls i replied to rutgers\nas well so and yes oklahoma state\nuniversity and colorado state university\nas well\nso these are the university that i had\napplied in fall 2020 and out of all\nthese universities i was accepted in all\nof them except for texas a m and\nuniversity of south florida\nthen in fall 2021 i again applied to\nnortheastern university but\na different course and in northeastern\nuniversity so there are two colleges cps\nand coe so i applied to coe and a\ndifferent course\nand then i applied to university of\nsouth florida because i really really\nlike their course\nbut they rejected me both the times\nand i applied to university of minnesota\ntwin cities because the gre was waved\noff\nand i again i applied to arizona state\nuniversity but a different program as\ncompared to fall 2021\nand university of texas at dallas so\ni applied to university of texas at\ndallas because it didn't defer my admit\nthe last time\nand out of this i was rejected from\nuniversity of minnesota and university\nof south florida and i was accepted from\nall the other universities\nso i hope that you learn something from\nmy experience and\nyou prepare well before making your\napplications and that is the reason why\ni shared my experience in this video\nif you like this video then please\nconsider subscribing my channel like and\nshare it as much as possible thank you\nso much see you in the next video bye\nbye",

    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owQHoRcaA2Y",
    "transcript": "hello everyone welcome to today's video\nmy name is akshala babar and i study\ndata analytics at northeastern\nuniversity so you might have noticed the\nchange in the backdrop that's because i\nam in san diego\nand this is my sublet so this is the\nplace where i'm staying temporarily\ntemporarily for three months uh during\nmy internship so today's video is going\nto be about the pros and cons of\nnortheastern university i was planning\nto do this video for quite a long time\nand finally\ni've got some time now i have a lot of\ntime now so let's start with the pros\nokay the first pro is that northeastern\nuniversity the main campus is situated\nin boston so boston is an amazing city\nuh it's called as the student city\nbecause there are so many universities\nwe have\nuh\nwe have harvard we have mit then there\nis boston university northeastern\nuniversity so you can do a lot of\nnetworking with students from these\nuniversities you can also attend the\ncareer fairs for these universities and\nlike basically get to know a lot of\npeople\nand because there are a lot of students\nin boston it is quite safe you can get\nout like at any time of the day and you\nwill see a lot of people on the road and\nit makes you feel safe\nboston has a very good public\ntransportation system as well and most\nimportant thing is that there are a lot\nof startups in boston uh and also in the\ncities around boston there are a lot of\nstartups and you have offices of almost\nall the big companies there is amazon\nthere is google so it's easier to\nnetwork with people and find jobs if you\nget an internship it is quite easier\nbecause you you usually you don't have\nto move out of boston so i think that is\nlike\nthe biggest pro for northeastern and\num it's not it's not in a suburban area\nit's a city area but it's not as\ncrowded as new york\nit's an amazing city i love boston and a\nmissing post is so much right\nanyway so the next um role i would say\nis the core program of northeast and i\ndon't think i have to tell you about\nthis but northeastern as a co-op program\num\nlike if you do this co-op program you\ncan do a co-op which from duration which\nlike a co-op with a duration of either\nfour months six months or eight months\nso let's say that uh like usually the\nco-op program is in cycles okay\nso you are allowed to do a co boundary\nuh you complete\ntwo semesters\nso after your two semesters you can\neither do uh you can either start a\nco-op in summer and do it like through\nthe entire fall till december or you can\ndo a co-op of six months or you can also\ndo an internship or a four-month co-op\nso it gives you a lot of flexibility and\nlet's say if you do not find an\ninternship during summer you can search\nfor an internship during the fall and\nlet's see if you do not find an\ninternship during the fall you can also\nsearch throughout the fall for a co-op\nthat starts during the spring so i think\nthis is a very big advantage because in\nother universities you can only do a\nsummer internship um but in northeastern\nyou get three chances so like you can\neither search for an internship during\nsummer fall or spring\nso that is amazing and the core program\nalso gives you like a lot of experience\nuh basically you're working in the\ncompany for six months or eight months\nso\nand also this is like paid co-op so\nyou're going to earn a lot you're going\nto be able to pay your semester fees\nyou're going to like network with all\nthe people in the company so it there's\na good chance that you're going to end\nup getting a full time in that same\ncompany so i think this is very good\nbecause you gain um like the industry\nexposure in the united states\nso the co-op program in northeastern is\namazing uh northeastern has a site\ncalled this new works where\nall the co-ops are like listed out and\nyou can apply to these co-ops and we\nalso get a co-op advisor like every\nstudent will have a co-op advisor and\nthe scope advisor helps you with\nreviewing your resume uh they also help\nyou with preparing for interviews they\ntake your mock interviews they just\nguide you throughout like with the\napplications and everything they help\nyou with the cpt and uh like before like\nyou can actually go for a co-op you have\nto take a co-op course and in this co-op\ncourse we are taught how to\nuh like make a resume how to talk to\npeople how to prepare a pitch so that\nyou can go and net career fairs and\nnetwork so all these facilities are\nprovided by northeastern uh not only\nthat but we also have a career design\ncenter i think most of the universities\nin the us have it but northeastern also\nhas it so you can schedule appointments\nwith them and they will guide you\none-on-one with your resume\nand you know just preparing your\ninterviews and cover letters and stuff\nlike that so that is another like a very\nvery very big pro i would say for\nnortheastern and this was the only\nreason that i chose northeastern uh it\nit was for the co-op program\nthen the third\none i would say were the research\nopportunities the northeastern has a\nreally good research opportunity so i'm\nnot someone who's into research but um\nlike we have this um research center and\nmost of the professors are into reason\nso you have to approach the professors\nand if your research work in the past\nmatches with the current research work\nthen they will interview you um like\nafter selecting your resume there will\nbe an interview and then you get an\nopportunity to opportunity to research\nwith them so if you are into research\nnortheastern has really amazing research\nopportunities and i have also read on\nthe website that northeastern uh carries\nout some research in collaboration with\nstudents from uh harvard so\nagain that's a really good opportunity\nto interact with people from harvard and\nget into these research programs um so\nif you ask me how to get into these\nprograms and stuff i have no idea\nbecause i have never\ntried to\nget into research\nthen i would say\nthere are a lot of international\nstudents in north northeastern like the\npercentage of international students is\npretty high\nso you do not feel out of place when you\ncome over here because everyone around\nyou is going through the same thing\neveryone is struggling with homesickness\num and it's like we are in the same boat\nso it's quite relatable and it's good to\nmake friends\nand\nyeah it's so it's good like it's quite\ngood the environment is really nice in\nnortheastern and also\nmost of the international students are\nindians\nso you'll you'll really find people from\nyour own hometown\nand\nyeah so i think that's\na pro\nuh but if you come to the cons\nthen\ni am going to consider this as a con\nlike a lot of international students\num mainly a con because it's like you\ncome\nto northeastern\nhoping that you will network with people\nwith different cultures but\neveryone around here is\nan international student and most of\nthem are from india\nso\nit's like\nyou just feel like you're\nin india\nand\nalso there's a lot of competition\nbecause of that because\neveryone is trying to get these jobs\nthat provide cpd everyone is trying to\nget the on campus jobs so there's a lot\nof competition because there are a lot\nof international students and most of\nthe international students are indians\neven during course selection\nlike whenever the course registration\ngoes out all the courses are full all\nthe classes are full in like three\nseconds\nso\nthere's always competition\nbetween the students in northeastern\nbecause uh like there are a lot of\nstudents\nso which comes to the second con of\nnortheastern which is the high intake so\never since after covert northeastern has\nreally increased the intake and there\nare like 500 to 300 students in a badge\ni mean in a class there are about 80\nstudents or 60 students or 45 students\nbut in a batch like if you consider the\ninformation systems total batch it will\nbe around 500 to 700\nand this this is creating a lot of\nproblems for all of the students because\nwe are not able to find proper housing\nand\nnot only the housing but\nthe rents are increasing because\nobviously the demand for housing is more\nso the rents are increasing um we even\nif you find a on-campus job you do not\nget complete 20 hours in that on campus\nshop so a student has to do multiple\non-campus jobs in order to complete 20\nhours and only if you complete 20 hours\nthen you'll be able to manage your\nliving expenses with the money that you\nwant from on campus and then even for\ncourse selection so usually\nlike everyone wants to follow the same\npath like we talk to our seniors and\nthen our seniors suggest uh suggest us\nto take like abc course in the first\nsemester so everyone wants to go for\nthat abc course then the course uh like\nwe are not able to find the uh like\ndesired courses during that right\nsemester so i think this is a major con\nof northeastern because\nit's like you're in a competition to\nfirst get into northeastern then once\nyou get into northeastern there is a\ncompetition to\nget your desired course then again there\nis a competition to get there on every\njob so it's like you're constantly\ncompeting and it's\nkind of crowded so now these students\nare high intake\nand yeah we'll always have to compete to\nget what you want\nthen i would say another con is\nboston\ni know this was a pro that\nnortheastern is in like the main campus\nof northeastern is in boston\nand i'm going to concentrate on boston\nbecause\ni study in boston\num boston is a con because it's quite\nexpensive when it comes to rent the rent\nis goes from around 850 to 1500 per\nperson for a private room if you want a\nshared room then obviously it can go\nlower but um like now that i am in san\ndiego and um like the other suburb that\ni'm going to so they have private rooms\nstarting from 6 50 700 per month so\nthat's quite good right but not easton\num does not have um\ncampus housing that is cheap the\non-campus housing in northeastern is\nlike 1700 and i think that is because it\nis in boston boston is quite expensive\neven the groceries\nand everything else everything is in\nboston is very expensive so\nyou will end up spending a lot and the\nmonthly\nbudget is going to be around like eight\nfifty two thousand dollars depending\nupon how much you eat and how is your\nlifestyle\nso that is a major con\nand not only boston is expensive but\nalso northeastern is quite expensive the\ntuition fees in northeastern is\nit so much it is so much\nlike we have to pay 1 600 and something\ni could don't i don't remember the exact\nnumber but yeah we have to be 1 600\nsomething per credit\nand you have to take nine credits per\nsemester\nso after like during the first semester\nyou'll pay like 15 lakh something\nincluding the\nhealth insurance and everything else but\nfrom the second semester your fees will\nbe around 13 to 14 lakh\nso this is quite expensive\nso this 13 to 14 lakh was an indian\nrupees by the way so this is quite\nexpensive for\nan indian student\nso that i'll say that's a really major\ncon in northeastern and even if you\nwork on campus you are going to\non\nlike enough to cover your rent\nand if you if you do 20 hours then you\nmight be able to cover their entire\nexpenses but if not then you will only\ncover your end\nthen\nuh\nyeah i think that\ni have covered most of the cons in\nnortheastern\nthe major one was like the\nyou know on-campus job\nyeah another con is that on-campus jobs\nso it's quite difficult to find on\ncampus jobs in northeastern so all the\ninternational students they hope that\nthey get an on campus shop because it\njust helps you cover your living\nexpenses but in northeastern it's very\ndifficult to get an on-campus job and\nlet me tell you all these on-campus jobs\nwork through reference so if you know\nsomeone who is working in a particular\nposition they will refer you and then\nyou will get an on-campus job but if\nyou're someone who doesn't know anyone\nin northeast northeastern it is quite\ndifficult to land on an on-campus job\nand even if you get an on-campus job\nthen it's very difficult to get 20 hours\num\nso this is like a never-ending story and\ni can continue to rant about it for an\nhour\nbecause i have tried to\nlike get another on-campus job and it's\nbeen forever\nso that's that's the thing in\nnortheastern\nyou do not land an on-campus job easily\nit takes a lot of time\nand arizo is like the most popular on\ncampus job in northeastern but even if\nyou get arrows so you have to you know\nkeep checking that portal and so that\nyou can pick up shifts because you're\nusually assigned only four to eight\nhours of shifts\num so yeah that's it um so these are the\nlike pros and cons and not these things\nand\nyeah this was a quite short video\num i tried to think of other pros and\nother cons but i think\nuh it would be generalized to all the\nuniversities in the united states in the\nunited states and i just wanted to stay\nspecific for northeast\nso yeah this was all for today's video\nbye\n[Music]\n[Applause]",

    "transcript": "one of f1's most popular and longest\nserving team bosses Gunter Steiner has\nleft his role in charge of H it's a\nshock move that poses serious questions\nabout the team's prospects and future\nit's almost Unthinkable to imagine H\nwithout Steiner as while the team Bears\nthe name of its owner Jean H this was\nreally Steiner F1 in all but name\nSteiner was the man who made f1's\nstrangest team setup possible and became\nan unexpected star of the Netflix drive\nto survive series we'll get into his\nimportance a little later in this video\nSteiner's depart with former director of\nengineering IO kamatsu taking over his\nteam principal has surprised almost\neverybody in F1 but there has been\ndiscontent bubbling away for some time\nnow and the situation had been coming to\na head behind the scenes now Steiner's\ngone and technical director Simone\nrester is understood to be out as well\nthere were frustrations with the way\nthat H was run from the very top and\nthat means aonomus team owner Jee H who\nwas seemly become apathetic towards his\nown F1 team and refused to invest in it\nSteiner and H disagreed on the team's\npotential in its current form with a\nlimited UK base in Banbury a technical\nfacility in Marinello where H has a\ncritical alliance with Ferrari and a\nBarely Used but excellent headquarters\nin the United States while Steiner felt\nhas needed steady investment over the\nnext few years as it had outgrown its\nunique multilocation Ferrari dependent\nmodel Gan Hass believes the team has\nunderachieved and does not need more\nresources or improved facilities to\nperform better this fundamental Clash\ncaused obvious tension and ultimately an\nirreconcilable difference Jean has wants\nsomeone who will run the team his way\nand Steiner is no longer that man even\nthe official announcement hints at the\nextent of the disagreements has stresses\ngreater efficiency maximizing the team's\npotential and his supposed desire to\ncompete properly in F1 KATU suggests the\nexisting parts just need to be\nrestructured and better LED and that the\nteam in its current form can achieve\nbetter results if that's to be taken at\nface value then the implication is\nkamatsu told Jean H exactly what he\nwanted to hear and that's why he now has\nSteiner's job it's highly likely some of\nthat lobbying took place in the latter\npart of 2023 There is almost certainly\nsome classic F1 politics behind\nSteiner's exit but there is also the\nthorny question of what jean Hass thinks\nhis F1 team is what he wants it to exist\nfor and what that means for it in\nreality H has always seemed happy just\nto let the team exist without wanting to\ninvest in it or sell it he doesn't need\nthe money and doesn't need the team to\nbe successful to benefit his H\nautomation brand that it was set up to\npromote in the first place in f1's\ncostat world with a better prize money\nspread for the worst performing teams\nthan before and a bunch of good partners\nthat ironically Steiner was absolutely\ncritical to getting on board hass's F1\nteam doesn't need to achieve much to\ntick over and either directly or\nindirectly make it worth the owner's\nwhile but that's an underwhelming\nexistence for a team in an Elite Sports\nand if Jee has sincerely believes that\nhis existing investment isn't being\nmaximized then he has misjudged the\nsituation badly H is f1's smallest team\nwith basic facilities and a convoluted\nstructure its banry UK base is\nunderwhelming and there's clearly some\ndysfunction to resolve there too badb\nbased kamatsu as team boss May at least\noffer more direct leadership than it had\nwith Steiner being based in the US and\nthe 2024 season will be a big test of\nhis leadership and has his confidence in\nthe team's\npotential without Steiner there would\nhave been no h F1 team while billionaire\nGan H had the money Steiner was key to\nmaking the project possible H had been\nCED by the ill- fated usf1 team that was\ndue to join the F1 Grid in 2010 that\npeaked his interest and along with\nSteiner he later started to work on an\nF1 team idea however after initial plans\nto run Ferrari customer cars were\ntorpedoed when it became clear the rules\nwould not allow this it seemed the\nproject was dead in the water Steiner\nknew that building a conventional F1\nteam from the ground up wasn't viable\nbut he recognized the listed Parts\nregulations meant there was a way to do\nit that didn't involve being supplied\nwhole cars by another team listed parts\nwere those that teams had to design\nthemselves in order to qualify as\nConstructor in 2016 this was the monoco\nsurvival cell front impact structures\nrollover structures Bodywork Wings floor\nand diffuser Steiner took the idea of\nthe technical partnership to extremes\nwith has taking everything it could from\nFerrari in exchange for serious cash\nwhat's more this meant the team could\nuse upto-date rather than year old Parts\nthe agreement also meant it could use\nFerrari's wind tunnel in Marinello\nSteiner also formulated the deal with\nItalian manufacturer darara not only to\nproduce the car but also do significant\ndesign work Steiner's unique management\nstyle has made him an unexpected star of\nthe Netflix drive to survive series and\ngives you an idea of his direct and to\nthe point approach in many ways he was\nthe ideal character to lead a small team\nlike this into F1 Steiner then was key\nin ensuring the team survived when the\ncovid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 hass's\ninterest in the team was waning amid\nfrustrations about the difficulties in\nraising sponsorship and there was every\nchance H would be closed down however\nSteiner was able to save the team with a\nstrategy involving extreme cutbacks and\neffectively writing off the 2020 and 21\nSeasons with minimal development a deal\nwas done to take on two rookies who\nwould bring backing Nikita maerin and\nMick schumacker and Jee has signed the\nNew Concord agreement thanks to the\nreduced cost cap and more equitable\ndistribution of prize money what's more\nSteiner's high profile means he was a\nvaluable asset to the team in terms of\nits wider profile and appeal to sponsors\nfor proof of that take a look at the\ncover of the F1 manager 23 game that\nfeatures Toto wolf Christian hoer and\nSteiner Steiner was Central in making\nthe team possible getting it on the grid\nkeeping it there and turning a team that\nonce could have been closed down into\none potentially worth a billion dollars\nor more he is therefore a massive loss\nthe man replacing Steiner I kamatsu has\nbeen part of H since its Grand Prix\ndebut in 2016 kamatsu had already spent\na decade in The Paddock by then first\nwith B Honda then Renault as that turned\ninto Lotus kamatsu became more visible\nas first Vitti Petro's race engineer\nthen in the same role for Roman Gran\nboth drivers were Podium finishers with\nkamatsu by their side Gran nearly a\ngrand prix winner kamatsu was eventually\npromoted into a more senior role within\nendstone before just as it became Reno\neffectively following groan to Hass\nthere he's headed up Trackside\noperations and has occasionally made\npublic facing appearances as the team's\nother senior figure at the track now\nthat he's the senior figure a lot more\nof those appearances will be coming up\nin\n2024 the appointment of kamatsu as team\nprinciple is very much a carryon as\nbefore decision that raises big\nquestions about a team that appears to\nbe wasting the massive opportunity\npresented to it by f1's growth and\ntransformed financial model at a time\nwhen it should be pushing on it's lost\nits team principal and technical\ndirector it's clear that kamatsu will\nfocus on the racing side of the\noperation with a chief operating officer\nset to be appointed to work out of its\nUK base focusing on other aspects of the\nteam it's understood the new coo will\nnot travel regularly to races this means\nthat katsu's Focus will be on improving\nthe way the team extracts the maximum\nPotential from what it already has it's\ndifficult to see him as being across as\neverything as Steiner was particularly\nwhen it comes to enticing sponsors the\nfact an internal appointment has been\nmade for its two key leadership\npositions with chief designer Andrea do\nzordo expected to take over his\ntechnical director doesn't present the\nimage of a team that's ripe for\nexpansion and new ideas there's every\nchance of an upturn in form given last\nyear's car was limited by a deadend\naerodynamic direction that didn't yield\nperformance gains in 2023 the car was\nquick enough to qualify in the top 10\nbut the tire degradation was terrible\nmeaning points were rare the big\nquestion is what impact kamatsu has in\nreshaping the team while there won't be\ndramatic changes he will have the\nopportunity to do things his way\ntherefore the effectiveness of his\nmethods and how the rest of the team\nresponds to him will have a big impact\non how successful passes this season a\ncomparison can be made with Andrea\nStella who stepped up from a comparable\nrole at McLaren to become team principal\nlast year this means such a move can\nwork although kamatsu is a very\ndifferent character given Steiner had a\nbig say in how the team worked there is\npotential for kamatsu to stamp his own\nway of doing things on the team however\nkatsu's hands may be tied by the\nfinancial limitations when it comes to\nwider changes and it's difficult to see\nhis team going anywhere its Rivals from\n2023 William stake and alatar are all\nbenefiting from heavy investment and new\nfacilities and H will fall behind in the\nlong term at a time when F1 is growing\nrapidly H risks being left behind as an\neternal tail\nEnder the change at the top of H\ninevitably raises the question of\nwhether it could be sold with andreti\nformula Racing's entry still in limbo\ndespite being accepted by the FIA could\nit move to buy h on paper it's an\nelegant solution for all parties Michael\nandreti has said that he's had several\nconversations in the past with Jean Hass\nabout the possibility he told Associated\nPress in May 2022 that H wasn't in\ninterested and that he didn't care if\nhe's running at the back Jean hass's\nposition appears to be unchanged but\nthere is a logic to such a move as he\nwould rake in a huge sum of money\nandreti would get a starting point for\nhis team and the standoff between the\nFIA and F1 over letting in an 11th team\nwould be resolved but sensible as that\nsounds right now this looks unlikely as\nandreti has said the team seems to work\nfor H and it's Machine Tools company so\nwhy would he sell however it can't be\nruled out and there's every chance that\nthe ruction at H might mean andreti or\nF1 itself tries again to make this\nhappen ultimately it will all come down\nto what Gan Hass wants and as Steiner's\nshock departure proves that appears to\nbe carry on as\nis",
